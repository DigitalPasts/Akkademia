(As for) the citizens of (the cities) Sippar, Nippur, Babylon, (and) Borsippa who through no fault of their own had been held captive in them (the fifteen cities), I put an end to their imprisonment and let them see the light (of day). (With regard to) their fields, which long ago, while the land was in disorder, the Sutians had taken away and appropriated for their own, I struck down (those) Sutians, the people of the steppe, with the sword. I (re)assigned to them (the citizens) their territories, (whose boundaries) had been forgotten (and) fallen into disuse during the troubled period in the land. I (re)-established the freedom (from obligations) of (the cities) Ur, Uruk, Eridu, Larsa, Kullab, Kissik, (and) Nēmed-Laguda. Moreover, I returned their gods that had been carried off as booty to their cult centers and I restored their regular offerings that had been discontinued.

(But) as for me, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the performing of this work came to my attention by the will of the gods and I put my mind to it. I forcibly removed the people of Chaldea, Aramean (tribes), the land of the Manneans, (and) the lands Que and Ḫilakku, who had not submitted to my yoke, then I made them carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks. I cut down canebrakes in Chaldea and I had their splendid reeds hauled (to Nineveh) for its (the palace’s) construction by enemy soldiers whom I had defeated.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 89 fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 820 small(er) settlements in their environs. I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans and Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, (and) Cutha, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four fortified cities and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, then I cut down their orchards (and) poured deathly quiet over their fertile fields. (In this manner) I reduced to desolation the land Ellipi to its full extent.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Maliḫu (Malaḫu), Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans. I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, 7,200 horses (and) mules, 11,073 donkeys, 5,230 camels, 80,100 oxen, (and) 600,600 sheep and goats.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
(but) not one among them had paid heed to (or) shown interest in the palace inside it, the seat of lordly dwelling whose site had become too small; nor had anyone (of them) conceived of and put his mind towards the straightening of the city’s street(s) and the widening of (its) squares, the dredging of the river, (and) the planting of orchards:
In the hidden depths of (its) subterranean waters I bonded together, with bitumen, reeds below (and) strong mountain stone above, then I raised (that) area out of the water and converted (it) to dry land. I filled in and measured a terrace of 700 large aslu-cubits along (its) longer side, 176 large aslu-cubits along (its) upper, northern shorter side, 268 large aslu-cubits along the inner, shorter side, (which is) opposite the zamû-wall of the shrine behind (the temple of) the goddess Ištar, 383 large aslu-cubits along the other, parallel, inner shorter side, (which is) on the west behind the ziggurrat of the temple of the goddess Ištar, (and) 386 large aslu-cubits along the lower, southern shorter side, (which is) beside the Tigris River. (80) In order to prevent its foundation from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), I surrounded its base with large limestone slabs (and thereby) reinforced its base. 
lamentation singers (kalû) who pacify (10) 
sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
The former palace, which was 360 cubits long, 80 cubits wide opposite the zamû-wall of the ziggurrat, (v 50) 134 cubits wide opposite the tower of the temple of the goddess Ištar, (and) 95 cubits wide opposite the tower of the Bīt-Kidmuri; which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly and that my handiwork be completed, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar revealed to me the presence of white limestone in the city Balāṭāya. (vi 25) Therein, I quarried mighty mountain sheep colossi, sphinxes, and large stone slabs for the gates of my lordly palace. 
Beside the city, in a botanical garden (one) pānu (in size and) a garden (one) pānu (in size) for a game preserve, I gathered every type of aromatic tree of the land Ḫatti, fruit trees of all lands, (and) trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea. Upstream of the city, on newly tilled soil, I planted vines, every type of fruit tree, and olive trees.
I surrounded (and) conquered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, their fortified walled cities. I brought out of them people, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, (ii 20) which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my lordly brilliance (iii 1) overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and he fled afar into the midst of the sea and disappeared. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, (iii 5) Bīt-Zitti, Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) and water-place(s), (iii 10) resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet. 
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and hung their corpses on towers around the city; (iii 65) I counted the citizens who had committed the criminal acts as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of crimes or wrongdoing, (to) whom no penalty was due, be allowed to go free.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress, whose scent is sweet, product(s) of Mount Amanus (vi 60) (and) the yield of Mount Sirāra, the holy mountains. I fastened bands of shining silver (and) bright copper on magnificent doors of cedar, cypress, (and) juniper and I installed (them) in their gates. (vi 65) I decorated them (the doors) with silver and copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of the copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
I provided irrigation for 500 seeded fields in the high fields of Nineveh with (that) water (and thereby) I made grain and cereals grow high and luxuriantly on 
I created a marsh to moderate the flow of water for (those) gardens and had a canebrake planted (in it). I let loose in it herons, wild boars (lit. “pigs of the reeds”), (and) roe deer. By divine will, (viii 35) vines, all kinds of fruit trees, olive trees, and aromatic trees flourished greatly in (those) gardens (planted) on newly tilled soil. Cypress trees, musukkannu-trees, (and) all kinds of trees grew tall and sent out shoots. (viii 40) The marshes thrived greatly. Birds of the heavens, heron(s) whose home(s) are far away, made nest(s) and wild boars (and) roe deer gave birth in abundance. 
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
In the corridors that are within the papāḫu-chambers, I made openings for latticed windows. At their gates, I stationed apotropaic figures of alabaster (and) elephant ivory, whose folded hands hold poppies, who are laden with pride (and) allure, (vi 35) (and) who are filled with exuberance, and (thus) I made (them) an object of wonder. 
I fastened bands of copper and tin on magnificent copper columns, as well as on large cedar columns, which are the product of Mount Amanus, then I installed (them) upon lion colossi and positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
which from distant days 
to its rear (vi 10'') 
I cut with iron picks a canal straight through mountain and valley, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. (Thus) I provided for eternity a regular supply of water from the Ḫusur River to the plain of Nineveh and I made (it) gush through small canals into the gardens (planted) on newly tilled soil.
I joyfully entered his palace, which is in Babylon, then I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, (i 30) precious stones, all kinds of possessions (and) property without number, a substantial tribute, (together with) his palace women, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, (ii 70) Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly. 
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
That Elamite, whose cities I had conquered and turned into ruins during a previous campaign to the land Elam, (v 40) accepted the bribe from them without thinking, then gathered his troops (and) his forces, inspected (his) chariots (and) wagons, (and) checked his teams (of) horses (and) mules.
I roofed them with magnificent beams of cedar grown on Mount Amanus, the holy mountain. I fastened bands of bright copper on doors of white cedar and I installed (them) in their gates. I had magnificent bull colossi fashioned from white limestone that was discovered in the territory of the city Balāṭāya and on the right and left I made (them) hold their door bolts.
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet. (i 15) Thus did recalcitrant rulers come to fear battle with me. While they were abandoning their settlements, they flew away alone like bats (living) in crevices to inaccessible place(s).
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and he fled afar into the midst of the sea and disappeared. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, Bīt-Zitti, (ii 40) Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) and water-place(s), resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet. 
On my fourth campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me so that I mustered my numerous troops and (iii 45) ordered the march to the land Bīt-Yakīn. In the course of my campaign, I defeated Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean who lives in the marshes, at the city Bittūtu. As for him, terror of doing battle with me fell upon him and his heart pounded. He fled alone like a lynx and his (hiding) place could not be found.
By the command of the god Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Mullissu, the queen, may I spend a long time (and) attain very old age in that palace in good health, happiness, and contentment. May my descendants be established therein forever, into the distant future. May the šēdu-spirit(s) who protect life, the god(s) who preserve well-being day and night, never leave it.
(As for) the king of the land Elam, who had come to the aid of the Babylonians, I marched to his land. I surrounded, conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire (his) fortified cities, his treasury, and the small(er) settlements in their environs, as far as the pass of the land Bīt-Bunaki.
in lamentation. Fear fell upon them. They opened the treasury of Esagil, sent gold, silver, (and) precious stones as a bribe to the king of the land Elam (Umman-menanu), (and) wrote to him as follows: “Hurry to Babylon and align yourself with us! Let us put our trust in you.”
... the Nergal Gate, which is opposite ... justice, who opens its gate.
At any time, when (anyone of) the people living in this city tears down his old house and builds a new one — if the foundation of his house encroaches upon the royal road, he will be hung (lit. “they will hang him”) on a stake over his house.
In> the uplands of Mount Ammanāna (northern Anti-Lebanon), they (Aššur and Ištar) disclosed to me the location of alabaster, which in the time of the kings, my ancestors, was too expensive (even) for the pommel of a sword. 
I made bull colossi of alabaster and copper, two of which were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, (together with) bull colossi (and) sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my lordly palatial halls.
At that time, I made the enemy people whom I had captured carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks.
The Tebilti River, a tempestuous flood (of water) which had flowed from distant days by the side of the palace (and) had shaken its base when its flood was in full spate: 
I built a palace of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, (and) elammaku-wood, for my lordly residence; then I had a portico, a replica of a Hittite palace, constructed opposite (its) gates. 
Moreover, breccia, as much as is needed (for making) burzigallu-bowls, (a stone) that had never been seen before, revealed itself at Kapridargilâ (“Dargilâ Village”), which is on the border of the city Tīl-Barsip.
In a pitched battled, I repulsed Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), (and) took away his rulership. I killed with the sword all of the Chaldeans, together with the massed body of Elamite troops, his allies.
I decorated them with silver (and) copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of their copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
In order to be able to draw water by bucket every day, I had bronze wire chains and bronze cables made and, instead of poles, I had tree trunks together with date palm(s) of copper placed over wells.
I entered his palace, which is in Babylon, and (then) I opened his treasury and carried off gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, the possessions (and) property of his palace.
I took the city Elenzaš as a fortress for that district, (and then) I changed its (former) name and called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of the governor of the city Ḫarḫar.
On my fourth campaign, I marched to the land Bīt-Yakīn. In the course of my campaign, I defeated Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean who lives in the marshes, at the city Bittūtu. As for him, he  became frightened of my weapons, and (then) he fled alone and his (hiding) place could not be found.
He, Maniye, heard about the advance of my expeditionary force, and (then) he abandoned the city Ukku, his royal city, and fled afar. I entered his palace and carried off every kind of possession (and) property, (which were) without number, his substantial treasure. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his cities, and made (them) like ruin hill(s) (created by) the Deluge.
They quarried bull colossi of white limestone in the city Tastiate to be their (the palatial halls’) gatekeepers. Throughout all of their lands they depleted forests of large trees to have boats built. In the month Ayyāru (II), the time of spring floods, they brought (the colossi) across to this side (of the river) with difficulty in magnificent boats. They sank large boats at the quay dock (and then) made their crews struggle (and) strain. With might and main, they struggled to transport (the colossi) and install (them) in their gates.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the city Ataun...

The Tablet of Destinies, the bond of supreme power, dominion over the gods of heaven and netherworld, sovereignty over the Igīgū and A­nun­na­kū gods, the secret of the heavens and the netherworld, the bond of the cover of the heavens (lit. “Anu”) and the netherworld (Ganzer), the lead-rope of mankind, which (the god) Aššur, king of the gods, took in his hand and held at his breast — a representation of his form, a replica of his proper appearance, is 
on it (the Tablet of Destinies): He grasps in his hand the lead-rope of the great heavens, the bond of the Igīgū and Anunnakū gods.
Through divination, at the command of the gods Šamaš and Adad, I built the akītu-house of the steppe for the qerītu-festival, which had been forgotten for a long time. I named it Eabbaugga, “House (where) Tiāmat Is Put to Death.” I named its cella Edubdubabba, “House that Makes the Host of Tiāmat Tremble.”
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
I found out the will of the gods Šamaš (and) Adad and they answered me with a firm ‘yes,’ and (then) the gods Šamaš and Adad commanded that that gate be opened towards the rising sun, facing east. At that time, I made several breaches in the wall, and (then) I opened a new gate towards (the god) Aššur, my lord, towards the east, and named it “The Royal Gate.”
(As for) the one who alters my inscribed object (and) disrespects my words, who does unkind things to ... and their offspring, may (the god) Aššur, king of the gods, and the great gods of heaven and netherworld curse him with a harsh, irreversible curse, and may they overthrow his kingship, deprive him of his life, (and) make his name, his seed, his offspring, and his progeny disappear in all lands.
I, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the one who fashioned image(s) of (the god) Aššur (and) the great gods, built this house for my second son Aššur-ilī-muballissu and I laid its foundation(s).

I captured alive in the midst of battle the magnates of the king of the land Elam, including Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of the land Karduniaš (Babylonia). 
On my second campaign, I marched quickly to Babylon, which I planned to conquer, and (then) I blew like the onset of a storm and enveloped it like a (dense) fog. I besieged the city; then, by means of sapping and ladders, I captured (it) (and) plundered the city. Its people, young and old, I did not spare, and I filled the city squares with their corpses. I carried off alive to my land Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), the king of Babylon, together with his family (and) his 
I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the city, and (its) buildings,  from its foundations to its crenellations. I removed the brick(s) and earth, as much as there was, from the (inner) wall and outer wall, the temples, (and) the ziggurrat, (and) I threw (it) into the Araḫtu river. I dug canals into the center of that city and (thus) leveled their site with water. I destroyed the outline of its foundations and (thereby) made its destruction surpass that of the Deluge. So that in the future, the site of that city and (its) temples will be unrecognizable, I dissolved it (Babylon) in water and annihilated (it), (making it) like a meadow.
... I roared loudly like a storm (and) thundered like the god Adad. By the command of the god Aššur, the great lord, my lord, I blew like the onset of a severe storm against the enemy. With the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, and my fierce battle array, I turned them back and made them retreat. The massed body of troops ... upon them. Ḫumbān-undaša ...

Before the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Nabû, (and) Marduk, the gods of Assyria, the gods who live in heaven and netherworld, he made them swear their solemn oath(s) concerning the safe-guarding of my succession. (i 20) In a favorable month, on a propitious day, in accordance with their sublime command, I joyfully entered the House of Succession, an awe-inspiring place within which the appointing to kingship (takes place).
The god Aššur, the father of the gods, gave me (the power) to let (cities) fall into ruins and to (re)populate (them, and) to enlarge Assyrian territory; the god Sîn, lord of the crown, decreed heroic strength (and) robust force as my fate; the god Šamaš, the light of the gods, elevated my important name to the highest rank; the god Marduk, king of the gods, made the fear of my kingship (ii 35) sweep over the mountain regions like a dense fog; the god Nergal, mightiest of the gods, gave me fierceness, splendor, and terror as a gift; (and) the goddess Ištar, the lady of battle and war, gave me a mighty bow (and) a fierce arrow as a present.
Moreover, Sanda-uarri, king of the cities Kundi and Sissû, a dangerous enemy, who did not fear my lordship (and) abandoned the gods, trusted in the impregnable mountains. He (and) Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, (iii 25) agreed to help one another, swore an oath by their gods with one another, and trusted in their own strength. I trusted in the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, and Nabû, the great gods, my lords, (iii 30) besieged him, caught him like a bird from the midst of the mountains, and cut off his head. “In Tašrītu (VII) — the head of Abdi-Milkūti! In Addaru (XII) — the head of Sanda-uarri!” I beheaded (both) in the same year: (iii 35) With the former I did not delay, with the latter I was quick. To show the people the might of the god Aššur, my lord, I hung (the heads) around the necks of their nobles and I paraded in the squares of Nineveh with singer(s) and lyre(s).
I trod on the necks of the people of Cilicia, mountain dwellers who live in inaccessible mountains in the neighborhood of the land Tabal, evil Hittites, (iii 50) who trusted in their mighty mountains and who from earliest days had not been submissive to the yoke. I surrounded, conquered, plundered, demolished, destroyed, (and) burned with fire twenty-one of their fortified cities and small cities in their environs. (As for) the rest of them, who were not guilty of (any) sin or crime, I imposed the heavy yoke of my lordship upon them.
The one who fled into the sea to save his (own) life did not escape my net and did not save himself. The swift (runner) who took to the stepped ridges of remote mountains, I caught him like a bird from the midst of the mountains and bound his arms. I made their blood flow like floodwater in mountain gullies. I ripped out the roots of the Sutû, who live in tents in a remote place, like the onslaught of a raging storm. Neither he who made the sea his fortress nor he who made the mountain his stronghold escaped my net (or) succeeded in escaping. (v 20) I ordered the (re)settling of those of the sea to the mountains (and) those of the mountains to the sea. At the command of the god Aššur, my lord, who can rival me in kingship? Moreover, who among the kings, my ancestors, was there whose dominion was as great as mine? From the midst of the sea, my enemies spoke thus: ‘Where can the fox go to get away from the sun?’

Moreover, I struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian, a barbarian whose home is remote, together with his entire army, in the territory of the land Ḫubušna.
The one who treads on the necks of the people of Cilicia, mountain dwellers who live in mountains in the neighborhood of Tabal, who trusted in their mountains and who from earliest days had not been submissive to the yoke — I surrounded, conquered, plundered, demolished, destroyed, (and) burned with fire (ii 10) twenty-one of their cities together with small cities in their environs. (As for) the rest of them, who were not guilty of (any) sin or crime, I imposed the heavy yoke of my lordship upon them.
I added ... fifty camels, (and) one thousand bags of aromatics to the tribute of his father and imposed (it) on him. 
I cried out in mourning, I raged like a lion, and my mood became furious. In order to exercise kingship (over) the house of my father I beat my hands together. I prayed to the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, and Nergal, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela and they accepted my word(s). With their firm ‘yes’, they were sending me reliable omen(s), (saying): ‘Go! Do not hold back! We will go and kill your enemies.’ 
Moreover, Sanda-uarri, king of the cities Kundi and Sissû, a dangerous enemy, who did not fear my lordship (and) abandoned the gods, (ii 40') trusted in the impregnable mountains. He (and) Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, agreed to help one another, swore an oath by their gods with one another, and trusted in their own strength. I trusted in the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, and Nabû, (ii 45') the great gods, my lords, besieged him, caught him like a bird from the midst of the mountains, and cut off his head. “In Tašrītu (VII) — the head of Abdi-Milkūti!

I fastened bands of gold on doors of cypress, whose fragrance is sweet, and installed (them) in its gates. I overlaid the cella of the god Aššur, my lord, with gold (and) set up side by side laḫmu-monsters (and) kurību-genii (made) of red ṣāriru-gold. I set up golden statues of creatures from the apsû on the right and left of the chapel of the god Aššur, my lord, (and) I covered (its) walls with gold as if (it were) plaster.
In that (same) year, I built anew Esagil, the palace of the gods, Imgur-Enlil, its (Babylon’s) wall, (and) Nēmed-Enlil, its (Babylon’s) outer wall, from their (text: “its”) foundations to their (text: “its”) battlements, and made (them) much bigger than before.

I had a foundation inscription written in my name and written in the name of Ashurbanipal, the senior son of the king, who (resides in) the House of Succession, my beloved son, and placed (this inscription) in it.

Moreover, (with regard to) he himself, by means of arrows, I inflicted him five times with wounds from which there is no recovery; and (as for) the city of Memphis, his royal city, within half a day (and) by means of mines, breaches, (and) ladders, I besieged (it), conquered (it), demolished (it), destroyed (it), (and) burned (it) with fire.

The god Marduk, king of the gods, will (then) hear his prayers.
(As for) the one who changes (an inscription) written in my name, defaces my representations, destroys my handiwork, may the great divine lord, the god Marduk, glare at him angrily among all of the rulers, and make his name (and) his descendant(s) disappear from the land.

You truly selected me, Esarhaddon, in the assembly of my older brothers, to put these matters right, and you (are the one) who placed your sweet protection over me, swept away all of my enemies like a flood, killed all of my foes and made me attain my wish, (and), to appease the heart of your great divinity (and) to please your spirit, you entrusted (me) with shepherding Assyria.
I was afraid (and) worried to preform that work (and) I knelt before the gods Šamaš, Adad, (and) Marduk, the great judge(s), the gods, my lords. In the diviner’s bowl, trustworthy oracles were established for me, and they had (their response) concerning the (re)building of Babylon (and) the renovation of Esagil written on a liver.
As time passed, the heart of the great lord, the god Marduk, was soothed and he became reconciled with the land that he had punished. As the seventy years passed, 
By means of the great intelligence (and) vast understanding which the sage of the gods, the prince, the god Nudimmud, gave to me, it occurred to me to (re)populate that city, to renovate its shrines, (and) to make the cult center shine, and my mind prompted (me).

that I had been waiting for, 
The people living in it (the city Qirbit) trusted in their rugged mountains and did not respect the dominion of Assyria. (As for) Tandāya — their city ruler who, to the kings, my ancestors, had never bowed down to (their) yoke — (his) heart was proud, ... They spoke ... and they were constantly plundering ... donkeys, oxen, ... in the steppe. (v 10') They laid waste to its pasture land. They ... the district of Yamutbal (and) flattened all of its settlements. With regard to these deeds, the citizens of Dēr appealed to me (and) beseeched my lordly majesty.
I hung the head of Teumman, the king of the land Elam, around the neck of Dunānu. With the spoils of the land Elam (and) the booty of the land Gambulu, which I captured by the command of (the god) Aššur, with singers performing music, I entered Nineveh in (the midst of) celebration.
(As for) Dunānu (and) Samgunu, sons of Bēl-iqīša — Gambulians whose ancestors had harassed the kings, my ancestors, and, moreover, (who) themselves disturbed my exercising the kingship — I brought them inside Baltil (Aššur) and the city Arbela to praise (me) in the future.
(As for) the cities Sais, Mendes, (and) Tanis, which had rebelled (and) sided with Taharqa, I conquered those cities (and) I killed the people living inside them with the sword. I hung their corpses on poles, flayed them, (and) draped the city wall(s with their skins). 
After Yakīn-Lû, the king of the land Arwad, had gone to (his) fate, Azi-Baʾal, Abī-Baʾal, (and) Adūnī-Baʾal, the sons of Yakīn-Lû who reside in the middle of the sea, came up from the middle of the sea, came with their substantial audience gift(s), and (ii 55') kissed my feet. I looked upon Azi-Baʾal with pleasure and installed (him) as king of the land Arwad. I clothed Abī-Baʾal (and) Adūnī-Baʾal in garment(s) with multi-colored trim (and) placed gold bracelet(s around their wrists). I made them stand before me.
(As for) Nabû-šuma-ēreš, the šandabakku (governor of Nippur) who did not honor (my) treaty, he suffered from dropsy, (that is) “full water.”
I skillfully made a bed of musukkannu-wood ... as a pleasure bed for the god Bēl (Marduk) (and) the goddess Bēltīya (Zarpanītu) to carry out the wedding (and) to make love. I placed (it) in Kaḫilisu, the bed chamber of the goddess Zarpanītu, which is laden with sexual charm.
Before my father was born (and) my birth-mother was created in her mother’s womb, the god Sîn, who created me to be king, named me to (re)build Eḫulḫul, saying: “Ashurbanipal will (re)build that temple and make me dwell therein upon an eternal dais.” The word of the god Sîn, which he had spoken in distant days, (ii 10') he now revealed to the people of a later generation. He allowed the temple of the god Sîn — which Shalmaneser (III), son of Ashurnasirpal (II), a king of the past (who had come) before me, had built — to become old and he entrusted (its renovation) to me.
I had statues of my royal majesty skillfully made ... through the craft of the deities Ninagal, Kusibanda, (and) Ninkurra, and, as constant petitioners for my life, I installed (them) in their positions before the gods who support me. From my childhood until I became an adult, I was assiduous towards the sanctuaries of the great gods. They required my priestly services (and) they (now) enjoy my giving (them) food offerings.
(As for) the sanctuaries of Assyria (and) the land Akkad whose foundation(s) Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, the father who had engendered me, had laid, but whose construction he had not finished, I myself now completed their work by the command of the great gods, my lords.
Silver, gold, precious stones, as much property of his palace as there was, garment(s) with multi-colored trim, linen garments, large horses, people — male and female — two tall obelisks cast with shiny zaḫalû-metal, whose weight was 2,500 talents (and which) stood at a temple gate, (iii 50') I ripped (them) from where they were erected and took (them) to Assyria. I carried off substantial booty, (which was) without number, from inside the city Thebes. (iii 55') I made my weapons prevail over Egypt and Kush and (thus) achieved victory. With full hand(s), I returned safely to Nineveh, my capital city.
On my sixth campaign, I marched against Urtaku, the king of the land Elam who did not remember the kindness of the father who had engendered me (nor) did he respect my friendship. After famine occurred in the land Elam (and) hunger had set in, I sent to him grain, (which) sustains the live(s) of people, and (thus) held him by the hand. (v 30) (As for) his people, who had fled on account of the famine and settled in Assyria until it rained (again) in his land (and) harvests grew — I sent those people who had stayed alive in my land (back) to him. But (as for) the Elamite whose aggression I had not thought possible (lit. “I did not speak with my heart”) (and) a fight with whom I had not contemplated — Bēl-iqīša, the Gambulian, Nabû-šuma-ēreš, the šandabakku (governor of Nippur), (v 40) servants who belonged to me, (and) Marduk-šuma-ibni, a eunuch of Urtaku who had sided with them, incited Urtaku, the king of the land Elam, with lies to fight with the land of Sumer and Akkad.
Before his messenger had arrived in his presence (and before) he could report the issuing of my decision to him, with the support of the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl (Marduk), Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nusku, (and) Nergal, who march at my side (and) kill my foes, (ix 45'') inside the land Elam, they (the Elamites) heard about the progress of the messenger of mine whom I had sent to the city Dēr... Fear of my royal majesty — with which the great gods had endowed me — overwhelmed the land Elam and (then) the people of the land Elam rebelled against Indabibi (and) (ix 50'') killed him with the sword. They placed Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), son of Atta-metu, on his (Indabibi’s) throne.
The deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl (Marduk) and Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, the great gods, my lords, decreed curses, as many as were written in their treaties, accordingly upon them.
(As for) that temple, which had become old, I removed its dilapidated section(s) by the command of the gods Sîn (and) Nusku. I made its structure larger than the one in the days of the past. I built (and) completed (it) from its foundation(s) to its crenellations. (i 55') Inside it, I built Emelamana, the temple of the god Nusku, the exalted vizier, which a king of the past (who had come) before me had built. I roofed them with long beams of cedar. I fastened band(s) of silver on doors of white cedar (and) I fixed (them) in their gateways.
Eunuchs of mine heard these words; they seized their mounted messenger(s) along with their messages and (then) they saw their deceitful acts. They seized Necho (and) Šarru-lū-dāri and clamped (their) hands and feet in iron fetters and iron handcuffs. (ii 40'') The oath (sworn) by (the god) Aššur, the king of the gods, defeated them and my kindness, which I had done for them as a favor, called to account those who had sinned against the treaty (sworn) by the great gods.
He brought before me (his) daughter, his own offspring, and the daughter(s) of his brothers to serve as housekeepers. He brought his son, who had never crossed the sea, to do obeisance to me. (iii 35') I received from him his daughter and the daughter(s) of his brothers, together with a large marriage gift. I had mercy on him and (then) I gave (his) son, his offspring, back to him.
Urtaku, whom I had not antagonized, set his attack in motion (and) hastily brought war to Karduniaš (Babylonia). On account of the assault of the Elamite, a messenger came to Nineveh and told me (the news). I was not concerned about this news of Urtaku’s assault. (v 1) (Because) he had regularly sent his envoys (with messages) of peace before me, I dispatched my messenger to see the king of the land Elam. (v 5) He went quickly, returned, and reported to me an accurate report, saying: “The Elamites cover the land Akkad, all of it, like a swarm of locusts.

When, by the commands of the gods Nabû and Marduk, the beloved of my royal majesty, and (with) the strong weapon of the awesome god Erra, the one who constantly strikes my enemies with lightning, I killed the Subarean (Assyrian) (and) turned his land into a mound of ruins (lit. “a mound and ruins”), at that time, (as for) Etemenanki —  the ziggurat of Babylon, which had become very weak (and) had been allowed to collapse before my time — the god Marduk — (my) lord — commanded me to firmly secure its foundation on the surface (lit. “breast”) of the netherworld (and) to have its summit rival the heavens.
With the knowledge of the god Ea, with the perspicacity of the god Marduk, with the wisdom of the god Nabû and goddess Nisaba, with the vast mind that the god who created me had allowed me to attain, (and) with my great sense of reason, I deliberated (matters) and (then) I commissioned well-trained craftsmen and (afterwards) a survey team measured the dimensions using a measuring rod. Master builders stretched out the (measuring) ropes (and) firmly established the ground plan. I made inquiries through divination to the gods Šamaš, Adad, and Marduk, and whenever (my) mind deliberated (matters) and took the dimensions into consideration,  the great gods responded to me through the outcomes of divination. 
O Marduk, (my) lord, joyfully look upon my good deeds and by your exalted command, which cannot be altered, may (this) construction, my handiwork, stay in good repair for ever. Like the bricks of Etemenanki, which are firmly in place for eternity, firmly secure the foundation(s) of my throne until the distant future.
