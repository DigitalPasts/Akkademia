May a future ruler read aloud this inscription, wash (it) with water, anoint (it) with oil, (and) make an offering. (Then) those gods will hear his prayers!
I/they killed Peqah, their king, and I placed Hoshea as king over them. I received from them ten talents of gold, ... talents of silver, together with their property, and I brought them to Assyria. 
I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire all of his cities. Like tells after the Deluge, I destroyed the lands Bīt-Šilāni, Bīt-Amukāni, and Bīt-Šaʾalli in their entirety, (and) turned (them) into mounds of ruins (lit. “mounds and ruins”). 
With the keen understanding (and) broad knowledge that the sage of the gods, the prince, the god Nudimmud (Ea), granted to me, I built in Kalḫu a cedar palace, ... for my lordly residence and a bīt-ḫilāni, a replica of a palace of the land Ḫatti (Syria-Palestine), for my pleasure. I made the dimensions of its site ... large cubits in length (and) sixty large cubits in width larger than the former palaces of my ancestors by (re)claiming (land) from the Tigris River (by filling it in)... 
The lands Namri, Bīt-Sangibūti, Bīt-Ḫamban, Sumurzu, Bīt-Barrūa, Bīt-Zualzaš, ... 
Palace of Tiglath-pileser (III), great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria: fifteen minas.
Ninurta-bēlu-uṣur, of the city Ṣirani, which is (in the area of) the city Ḫalaḫḫi, which is  in front of the city Lipapan in the mountains, (and) my ancestral city: 
May every work of my hands be acceptable to the gods who dwell in this city. May they then forever decree that (they will) inhabit their shrines and that my reign will be firmly established.
I built inside it (the city) palatial halls using (lit.: “of”) elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, daprānu-juniper, (25) juniper, and terebinth. I then fashioned a bīt ḫilāni, a replica of a Hittite palace, in front of their gates (30) and roofed them with beams of cedar (and) cypress. I wrote my name upon tablet(s) of gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, lapis lazuli, (and) alabaster and placed (them) in their foundations.
In my eighth regnal year, that which in the course of my previous campaign against Aššur-lēʾi, king of the land Karalla ... 
In the month of Duʾūzu (IV) — (the month) that determines matter(s) for humankind; the month of the mighty one, the eldest son of the god Enlil, the most powerful of the gods, the god Ninurta; (and the month) for which the lord of wisdom, the god Ninšiku (Ea), had inscribed on an ancient tablet the assembly of armies (and) the preparation of a (military) camp — I set out from my royal city Kalḫu and impetuously crossed the Upper Zab River while it was in full (flood). On the third day, in order to muzzle the mouth of the boastful (and) shackle the legs of the wicked, I reverently prostrated myself before the god Enlil (and) the goddess Mullissu. (10) I then had the troops of the gods Šamaš (and) Marduk leap across the Lower Zab River, whose fording is difficult, as if it were a ditch. I entered the passes of Mount Kullar, a high mountain of the land Lullumû, which is (also) called the land Zamua. I held a review of my army in the district of the land Sumbi and checked the number of horses and chariotry.
I, Sargon (II), king of the four quarters (of the world), shepherd of Assyria, who keeps oath(s) (sworn) by the gods Enlil (and) Marduk (and) pays attention to the decision of the god Šamaš; the offspring of (the city) Baltil (Aššur), the city of wisdom (and) understanding (lit.: “open with regard to ears”); who reverently pays heed to the words of the great gods and does not question their plan(s); the just king, who (only) speaks benevolently, for whom slander is anathema, (and) from whose mouth (orders) to commit treachery (and) do wrong never come forth; wisest ruler in the world, who was created with intelligence and understanding, (and) who upholds with his hand reverence for the gods and goddesses —
Furiouly, I overwhelmed the region around that district like a fog and compacted the length and breadth (of it) like ice. In a lordly manner, I entered the city Ulḫu, the city where Ursâ (Rusâ) went for relaxation, and walked about triumphantly in the palace (that had been) his (own) royal abode. With iron axes and iron spades, I smashed its strong (city) wall, which had been built with (blocks of) massive mountain stone, as if (it were) a pot, and leveled (it) down to the ground. I tore out the lengthy beams of juniper (that formed) the roof of his palace, cut (them) up with pickaxes, and took (them back) to Assyria. I opened up his granaries (and) storehouses and (then) fed my army his abundant grain in unlimited quantities. (220) I entered his hidden wine cellars, and the extensive troops of the god Aššur drew sweet wine (to drink) from waterskins (and) leather buckets as if (it were) river water. I blocked up the outlet of the canal, the canal on which he relied (to provide water), and turned the abundant water (supply) into a swamp. I stopped up the irrigation ditches (and) drainage pipes that forked off from its (the canal’s) center, and exposed ... their pebbles to the sun. I had my fierce warriors enter his well-kept gardens, (which provide) the general impression of his city (and) which were (so) studded with fruit trees and grapevines that they dripped (fruit as abundantly) as a rainfall, and they (the warriors) made the noise of (their) iron pickaxes resound like (the thunder of) the god Adad. (225) They picked a great deal of its fruit, a countless amount, and did not leave (any) for the weary heart to smile about in the future. I (cut down and) spread out his large trees, the ornaments of his palace, like malt (spread out for drying); I made his famous city disgusting and its district a subject of revilement. I gathered up those logs — all the trees that I had chopped down —, piled (them) up in heaps, and set them on fire. I tore out by the roots their abundant crops, which are as countless as reeds in a canebrake, and did not leave even a (single) ear of barley to allow the identification of what had been destroyed. (With regard to) his well-kept field(s) that were spotted with colored flecks like polished lapis lazuli and (whose) meadowland(s) were planted with new vegetation and young shoots, (230) like the god Adad, I trampled (it) down with (my) chariotry, (my) cavalry, (and) the passage of my infantry, and I turned the meadows that his horses had relied on (for pasture) into wasteland. (With regard to) the city Sarduriḫurda, their large fortress, together with fifty-seven settlements in the environs of the district Sangibutu, I destroyed all of them, leveling (them) down to the ground. I set fire to their roof-beams and turned (them) into ashes.

I conscripted from among them 200 chariots, 600 cavalry, (and) shield (and) spear (bearers), and I added (them) to my royal (military) contingent. I disregarded the crime(s) of (ii' 5) 6,300 guilty Assyrians, had pity upon them, and settled them in the land Hamath. I imposed on them (the same) tribute, payment(s), labor duty, (and) (ii' 10) military service as the kings, my ancestors, had imposed on Irḫulena of the land Hamath.

In my rage, I unleashed a fierce assault on Cutha, then I slaughtered the warriors surrounding its wall like sheep and took possession of the city. I brought out horses, the Elamite, Aramean, (and) Chaldean archers, the Elamite unit commanders, and Nergal-nāṣir, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
I let my army eat the grain (and) dates in their gardens, the fields they had labored in, (and) the crops in the countryside, which is their life’s necessity.
I returned safely to Assyria with 208,000 substantial captives, 7,200 horses (and) mules, 11,073 donkeys, 5,230 camels, 80,050 oxen, (and) 800,100 sheep and goats. This is apart from the people, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats that all of my troops had carried away and appropriated for themselves. 
The line count of the inscription is 94 (lines).
To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, I cut with iron picks a canal straight through mountain and valley, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. I caused an inexhaustible supply of water to flow there for a distance of one and a half leagues from the Ḫusur River (and) made (it) gush through feeder canals into those gardens.
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of Assyria, unrivalled king, pious shepherd who reveres the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning: 
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy who since time immemorial had not submitted to my yoke, and I did not leave one alive. I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords. 
As for him, Hezekiah, fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed him and, after my (departure), he had the auxiliary forces (and) his elite troops whom he had brought inside to strengthen the city Jerusalem, his royal city, thereby gaining reinforcements, (along with) 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, choice antimony, large blocks of ... , ivory beds, armchairs of ivory, elephant hide(s), elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, garments with multi-colored trim, linen garments, blue-purple wool, red-purple wool, utensils of bronze, iron, copper, tin, (and) iron, chariots, shields, lances, armor, iron belt-daggers, bows and uṣṣu-arrows, equipment, (and) implements of war, (all of) which were without number, together with his daughters, his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh, my capital city, and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment and to do obeisance.
I tore down that small palace in its entirety, then I changed the course of the Tebilti River, repaired (the effects of) the erosion, and directed its outflow.
In the future, may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that ... becomes old and dilapidated.

(As for) the one who alters my inscribed object (and) disrespects my words, may (the god) Aššur, king of the gods, and the great gods of heaven and netherworld curse him with a harsh, irreversible curse, and may they overthrow his kingship, deprive him of his life, (and) eradicate his name, his seed, his offspring, (and) his progeny from the mouth of the people.
I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city. 
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, (ii 15'') oxen, and sheep and goats without number, then I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements (ii 20'') in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria. 
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and (iii 5) he fled afar into the midst of the sea and disappeared. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, Bīt-Zitti, Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, (iii 10) Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) and water-place(s), resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet.

Nisannu (I), the twenty-seventh day, eponymy of Nabû-dūrī-uṣur, governor of the city Tamnunna (697).
On my return march, I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son (whom I) raised on my (own) knee, on his lordly throne and entrusted him with the wide land of Sumer and Akkad.
On my fifth campaign: The population of the cities Tumurrum, Šarum, Ezāma, Kibšu, Ḫalbuda, Qūa, (and) Qana, whose dwellings are situated like the nests of eagles, the foremost of birds, (iv 75) on the peak of Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain, and who had not bowed down to the yoke — I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Nipur. 
I quickly slaughtered and defeated Ḫumban-undaša, (... )
I cut off (their) lips and (thus) destroyed their pride. I cut off their hands like the stems of cucumbers in season.
After I had finished the work on my palace, (viii 25'') I invited inside it the god Aššur, the great lord, (and) the gods and goddesses living in Assyria, then I made splendid offerings and presented my gift(s). I made fine oil from olives and aromatics. (viii 30'') At the inauguration of the palace, I had the heads of the subjects of my land drenched (and) I watered their insides with sweet wine.
Then, from the city Opis, they lifted them (the boats) up onto dry land and dragged them on rollers to Sippar.
I joyfully entered his palace, which is in Babylon, then I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, (i 30) precious stones, all kinds of possessions (and) property without number, a substantial tribute, (together with) his palace women, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. (ii 15) I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
I raged up like a lion, then put on armor (and) placed a helmet suitable for combat on my head. (v 70) In my anger, I rode quickly in my exalted battle chariot, which lays enemies low. I took in my hand the mighty bow that the god Aššur had granted to me (and) I grasped in my hand an arrow that cuts off life.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tu­ʾu­mu­na, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, (i 40) Malaḫu, Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Pu­qu­du, Ḫamrānu, Ḫa­ga­rā­nu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans... (i 45) I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. (iii 1) With the support of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and defeated them. In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road against Maniye, the king of the city Ukku (and) an insubmissive mountain-dweller. (iv 10) Before my time, none of the former kings of the past had marched through the untrodden paths (and) difficult trails on account of the rugged mountains. I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Anara and Mount Uppa, mighty mountains, and I myself, in an armchair, (iv 15) with my crack combat troops, entered their narrow passes with great difficulty and ascended with a struggle the steep mountain peaks.
On my seventh campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land Elam. In the course of my campaign, I conquered and plundered the cities Bīt-Ḫaʾiri (and) Raṣā, cities on the border of Assyria that (iv 50) the Elamites had taken away by force in the time of my ancestor(s). I had my garrisons stationed inside them. I brought (those cities) back inside the border of Assyria and placed (them) under the authority of the garrison commander of Dēr.
together with the cities of the passes, namely Bīt-Bunaki, Tīl-Ḫumbi, Dimtu-ša-Dume-ili, Bīt-Ubiya, Baltī-līšir, Taqab-līšir, (iv 65) Ša-nāqidāte, Masūtu-šaplīti, Sarḫudēri, Ālum-ša-Bēlet-bīti, Bīt-Aḫḫē-iddina, (and) Ilteuba — I surrounded, conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire (those) thirty-four fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number. I made the smoke from their conflagration cover the wide heavens like a heavy cloud.
Kudur-Naḫundu (Kudur-Naḫḫunte), the Elamite, heard about the conquest of his cities and fear fell upon him. He brought (the people of) the rest of his cities into fortresses. He abandoned the city Madaktu, his royal city, and took the road to the city Ḫaydala, which is in the distant mountains. 
(As for) the rest of his magnates, who had raised their arms because they were terrified of doing battle with me, I captured them alive in the thick of battle. 
(As for) him, Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam, along with the king of Babylon (and) the sheikhs of Chaldea 
I put to the sword the people of the city Tumurrum, who live on Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain. I swept over the city Ukku, together with every last one of its settlements, (so that they looked) like a ruin hill (created by) the Deluge.
(As for) the king of the land Elam, who had come to his (Šūzubu’s) aid, I marched to his land. I surrounded, conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his fortified cities, his treasury, and small(er) settlements of his in their environs, as far as the pass of (the land) Bīt-Bu­na­ki.
The great gods, ... , my lords, ... into their shrines ... I graciously settled (them) on their daises ... I offered fattened bulls (and) fattened sheep as sacrifices ... I presented my gift(s) to them and ... before them.
I built Ešaḫulezenzagmukam, “House of Joy and Gladness for the Festival of the Beginning of the Year.”
The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar granted me a weapon without equal and gave me the strength (lit. “opened my arms”) to destroy those hostile to Assyria. With their great support, (10) I constantly directed my troops in safety from east to west and I made all of the rulers who sit on (royal) daises throughout the four quarters (of the world) bow down at my feet and they (now) pull my yoke. 
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), favorite of the great gods: 
By divine will, I created clay mold(s) of tree trunks and date palm(s), (of) twelve raging lions, as well as (of) twelve magnificent bull colossi (and) twenty-two sphinxes, and I poured copper into it. I perfected their form(s).
By the command of the god Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Ištar, the queen, may we both live long and be satisfied with (our) prosperity in these palatial halls in good health and happiness. May the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu surround these palatial halls forever and ever. May they never leave them.
I fastened bands of copper on magnificent copper columns, as well as on large cedar columns, which are the product of Mount Amanus, and (then) I installed (them) upon lion colossi and positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
In order to be able to draw water by bucket every day, I had bronze wire chains and bronze cables made and, instead of poles, I had tree trunks and date palm(s) placed over wells.
To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, I cut with iron picks a canal straight through a mountain, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. I caused an inexhaustible supply of water to flow there for a distance of one and a half leagues from the Ḫusur River (and) made (it) gush through feeder canals into those planted areas.
The palace in the citadel of Nineveh, whose extent was 360 cubits on (its) longer side (and) 95 cubits on (its) shorter side, and  whose site was too small; alongside of which the Tebilti River had flowed, (35) caused erosion in its foundations, (and) shaken its base; (and) which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
I made bull colossi with copper features, two of which were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, (and) bull colossi of alabaster, together with bull colossi (and) sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my palatial halls.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the throne over them, and (then) I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
Like a fierce wild bull, with my merciless combat troops, I took the lead of them (the soldiers in my camp). I proceeded through the gorges  (and) the rugged mountain slopes in (my) chair. Where it was too difficult for (my) chair, I leapt forward on my (own) two feet like a mountain goat. Where my knees gave out (and) became tired, I sat down upon the mountain rock and drank cold water from a water skin to (quench) my thirst. 
I fastened bands of copper on magnificent copper columns, as well as on large cedar columns, which are the product of Mount Amanus, and (then) I installed (them) upon lion colossi and positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
... (and) which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the city Alammu.
Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, had the (inner) wall and outer wall of Nineveh built anew and raised as high as mountain(s).
Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, built a house in connection with the start of the work on the wall of Nineveh for his son and gave (it to him).
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, and (then) I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
They (the Babylonians) opened the treasury of Esagil and sent my gift(s) — the silver, gold, (and) precious stones that I had given as presents to the god Bēl (Marduk) and the goddess Zarpanītu, the property (and) possession(s) of the temple of their gods — as a bribe to Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam, who does not have sense or insight... previously and they took an oath. They gave him the order to muster his army (and) to ... He gathered his army, inspected (his) chariots (and) wagons, ... 
Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), became frightened by my battle array; he shred his lordly garments and quickly departed from Babylon.
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), favorite of the great gods: The god Aššur (... ) made (all of) the insubmissive kings from the rising sun to the setting sun bow down at his feet and they (now) pull his yoke.
I had a large private room constructed anew to be my lordly seat (and) through the craft of well-trained master builders I built (and) completed (it) from its foundations to its battlements. I roofed it with magnificent beams of cedar grown on Mount Amanus... I fastened (metal bands) on facing doors of white cedar and I installed (them) in its gate. 
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not submitted to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house and took him to Assyria. 
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. With the support of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and ... I captured ... 
I, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the one who fashioned image(s) of (the god) Aššur and the great gods, built this house for my second son Aššur-ilī-muballissu, who (is) in the service of (the god) Aššur, and I laid its foundation(s) with limestone, stone from the mountains.
With a rejoicing heart and a radiant face, I rushed to Babylon and entered the palace of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan) to plunder the possessions and property therein. I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, beds, armchairs, a processional carriage, royal paraphernalia of his with gold (and) silver mountings, all kinds of possessions (and) property, a substantial treasure, (together with) his wife, his palace women, female stewards, eunuchs, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, palace servant(s) who cheered up his princely mind, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Maliḫu (Malaḫu), Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans, and I plundered them.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) devastated those ... Their escapees (... ) upon the peaks of Mount Nipur ... I pursued their ... on the peaks of the mountains.
(To) a later ruler, one of the kings, my descendants, who deliberates (the matter) in (his) heart but is not able to believe (it), (and) says “How did he have this canal dug out with (only) these few men?”: I swear by the god Aššur, my great god, that I dug out this canal with (only) these men. Moreover, I completed the work on it within one year (and) three months; ... was completed (and) I finished digging its excavation.
I brought out ... precious stones, utensils of ... attendants, male singers, ... and I counted (them) as booty... 
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), favorite of the great gods, wise prince, circumspect ruler, shepherd of the people, (and) leader of a widespread population, I:
(As for) Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, (who) did not fear my lordship (and) did not listen to the words of my lips, who trusted in the rolling sea and threw off the yoke of the god Aššur — I leveled Sidon, his stronghold, which is situated in the midst of the sea, like a flood, tore out its wall(s) and its dwelling(s), and (ii 70) threw (them) into the sea; and I (even) made the site where it stood disappear. Abdi-Milkūti, its king, in the face of my weapons, fled into the midst of the sea. By the command of the god Aššur, my lord, I caught him like a fish from the midst of the sea and cut off his head. I carried off his wife, his sons, his daughters, (ii 75) his palace retainers, gold, silver, goods, property, precious stones, garments with trimming and linen(s), elephant hide(s), ivory, ebony, boxwood, everything of value from his palace in huge quantities, (and) took away his far-flung people who were beyond counting, oxen, sheep and goats, and donkeys in huge numbers (ii 80) to Assyria. I gathered the kings of Ḫatti (Syria-Palestine) and the seacoast, all of them, and had (them) build a city in another place, and I named it Kār-Esarhaddon.
I placed crossbeams on large copper columns (and) tall cedar columns, (thus forming) a cornice in their gates. I had the frieze(s) (and) coping(s) of the whole of that palace made of black and blue (glazed bricks) and I put (them) around (it) like a wreath. I surrounded all of the gates with an arch and a vault like a rainbow. I embedded nails of silver, gold, and shining copper in them. Through the craft of the sculptor, I depicted on it (the frieze of the palace) the might of the god Aššur, my lord, (and) the deeds that I had accomplished in enemy lands. 
After the gods Aššur, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela made me stand victoriously over my enemies and I attained everything I wanted, with the booty of the vast enemies which my hands had captured (iv 25')  through the help of the great gods, my lords, I had the shrines of cult centers built in Assyria and Akkad; I decorated (them) with silver (and) gold and made (them) shine like daylight. 
Abu (V), eighteenth day, ... 
whose goods, possessions, (and) gods, together with Apkallatu, the queen of the Arabs, he (Sennacherib) plundered and brought to Assyria — Hazael, the king of the Arabs, came to Nineveh, my capital city, with his heavy audience gift and kissed my feet. He implored me to give (back) his gods, and (iii 5') I had pity on him. I refurbished the gods Atar-samayin, Dāya, Nuḫāya, Ruldāwu, Abirillu, (and) Atar-qurumâ, the gods of the Arabs, and I inscribed the might of the god Aššur, my lord, and (an inscription) written in my name on them and gave (them) back to him. I placed the lady Tabūa, who was raised in the palace of my father, as ruler over them and returned her to her land with her gods.
... I sent my officials, the governors of the boundary areas of their land, with them and they trampled the people living in those cities (and) made (them) bow down at their feet. I imposed the tribute (and) payment of my lordship upon them. 
Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, who knows how to greatly revere the gods and goddesses, the one who (re)constructed the temple of the god Aššur (and) (re)built Esagil (and) Babylon; son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria; descendant of Sargon (II), king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, (and) king of Sumer and Akkad — 
Esarhaddon, ... king, ... king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, pious prince, humble, ... who knows how to revere all of the gods and goddesses, ... 
... its site had become too small and not ... my wish ... a small palace for my princely residence ... (5') ... I built (and) completed (it) from its foundations to its parapets ... he returned ... days ... 
... when they were coming to Nineveh ... when they were clothing him in linen (and) garments with multicolored trim, putting gold rings on his hands (and) ... his ... , (then) he (no longer) said ‘woe!’ and (no longer) uttered cries of mourning. 
I am sending the best report to the god Aššur, my lord, by so-and-so. One charioteer, two cavalrymen, (and) three scouts are dead.
When the god Aššur, king of the Igīgū and Anunnakū gods, father of the gods, lord of the lands; the god Anu, the powerful, the foremost, whose spoken order no god can alter; the god Enlil, greatest lord, the one who decrees the fates of heaven and netherworld (and) makes the dwellings secure; the god Ea, the wise, lord of wisdom, creator of (all) creatures, the one who fashions everything, whatever its name; (5) the god Sîn, the one who constantly renews himself, the pure god, the one who determines decisions (and) reveals signs; the god Šamaš, the great judge of the gods, the one who illuminates darkness, whose lordly splendor overwhelms the lands; the god Adad, the canal inspector of heaven and netherworld, the one who brings abundant rains (and) sustains (all) living things; the god Marduk, firstborn son, the Enlil of the gods, the one who has the power to depopulate and (re)settle (a region); the god Nabû, scribe of the universe, the one who directs the Igīgū and Anunnakū gods (and) who is entrusted with the entire universe; (10) the god Nergal, the almighty, endowed with strength and power, the one who captures enemies, the Enlil of the vast netherworld; the goddess Agušāya (Ištar), mistress of war and battle, the one who starts fighting (and) causes conflict; the Sebitti, valiant gods, who hold bow (and) arrow, whose assault is combat (and) warfare; (and) the great gods, who reside in heaven and netherworld, whose favorable words cannot be changed,
truly selected me, Esarhaddon, with their pure, upraised eyes, to shepherd their people, they raised ... , they decreed a favorable fate for me, ... , (and) they elevated me to the kingship (so I could) placate their mood; ... truly they stretched out over me; ... they truly called my name; they gave me ... (and) broad wisdom; they opened my mind ... to refurbish the great gods, ... of the cults.
(As for) red gold, an ore from its mountain which nobody had (yet) cast into a work of art, (and) countless precious stones, that have not (yet) seen (the light of) day, the creation of the mountains where the god Ea greatly decreed their fate to be the radiance for the artwork of lordship, I had (them) greatly prepared and delivered to their (the craftsmen’s) pure hands for the shrines of the great gods, my lords, and for the ornamentation of their divinity. I had an artfully (designed) crown, which is befitting the lordship (85) of the god Aššur, king of the gods, my lord, made of red gold and precious stones, and I restored it. The god Aššur, the great lord, accepted magnanimously that crown, (which is) clothed in splendorous radiance, full of dignity, radiating a glow, (and) wrapped in brilliance, and his spirit was pleased (and) his countenance shone.
I gave ... as a gift to the god Nabû, my lord. I built (and) completed ... The gods living in them ... of shining ... and a spade of red gold ... that had become old, I had built anew. (rev. 5) ... I had ... made of silver and ... in Emašmaš, the chapel of the goddess Mullissu, my lady. I renewed what was old of the ... of the god Nabû (and) the goddess Tašmētu, (and) repaired what had fallen off... in it and I made kneel before them. (As for) ... which had not been built (previously) in Nineveh, near the citadel gate, I had ... lions, anzû-birds, (and) laḫmu-monsters made of silver (and) shining copper and ... 
(As for) Baltil (Aššur), the foremost cult city, whose privileged status had been established with (that of) the people of Anu (and) Enlil from early days and (ii 35) whose kanakku-status ... — I, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, love the inhabitants of Baltil (Aššur) (ii 40) like my own precious life (and thus) it occurred to me and my heart prompted me to greatly increase their freedom more than before.
I built (it) for my life, the prolongation of my days, the securing of my reign, the well-being of my seed, the safeguarding of the throne of my priestly office, the overthrowing of my enemies, the prospering of the harvest of Assyria, (and) the well-being of Assyria.
Moreover, I struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian, together with his entire army, in the territory of the land Ḫubušna; I conquered Sidon, which is in the midst of the sea, caught Abdi-Milkūti, its king, like a fish, and cut off his head; I conquered the city Arzâ, which is in the neighborhood of the Brook of Egypt, threw Asuḫīli, its king, into fetters and took him to Assyria; I conquered the city Bāsu (Bāzu), a district in a remote place; I fixed the tribute of my lordship on Qanâ, king of Dilmun; 
The palace of Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, skilled in battle and warfare, who leveled his enemies, son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria, descendant of Sargon (II), king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad — an amphora filled with oil fit for princes, which was with the vast possessions (and) goods without number, the treasures of the palace of Abdi-Milkūti, the king of Sidon, that my great hand(s) captured with the help of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela.
the one who drove out Nabû-zēr-kitti-līšir, son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan); the one who sacked Bīt-Dakkūri, which is in Chaldea, an enemy of Babylon; the one who captured Šamaš-ibni, its king, a rogue (and) outlaw  — I surrounded, captured, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Ḫandasu, Magalani, Alpiana, Diḫrāni, Qatabuʾ, Padê, (and) Udēru, fortified cities in the district of the land Bāzu, together with small cities in its environs. 
The palace of Esarhaddon, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, son of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, descendant of Sargon (II), king of Assyria.
I established anew the remission of debts of the wronged citizens of Babylon, people (entitled to) the privileged status (and) freedom (guaranteed by) the gods Anu and Enlil. I gathered the bought people who had become slaves (and) who had been distributed among the (foreign) riffraff and counted (them once again) as Babylonians. I returned their looted possessions, provided the naked with clothing, (and) let them take the road to Babylon. I encouraged them to (re)settle the city, build houses, plant orchards, (and) dig canals. 
At that time, in the reign of a previous king, bad omens occurred in Sumer and Akkad. The people living there were answering each other yes (for) no (and) were telling lies. They led their gods away, neglected their goddesses, abandoned their rites, (and) embraced quite different (rites). They put their hands on the possessions of Esagil, the palace of the gods, an inaccessible place, and they sold the gold, silver, (and) precious stones at market value to the land Elam.
At that time, I had the terrace, the place where the gods Marduk, Zarpanītu, (and) Nabû dwell, dug down 16 cubits, (where) I reached ground water. With bitumen and baked brick, I enlarged its lower part beyond the water table and I built up its foundations as the god Nudimmud had instructed me. I raised (it) up and heaped (it) up like a mountain for the residence of his great divinity. I built the home of the gods Marduk, Zarpanītu, and Nabû in their midst.
Let me enlarge my family, gather my relatives, (and) extend my progeny so that they branch out widely; let him make the foundations of the throne of my priestly office as secure as a great mountain; let my reign endure as long as heaven and earth; let me stride beaming daily in joy, gladness, happiness, shining face, and happy mood; (and) let a happy fate, a good fate, (one) for the lengthening of the days of my reign, the protection of the throne of my priestly office, (and) the well-being of my offspring be placed in their (the gods’) mouths.
Accession year of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria.
Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, pious prince who reveres the gods Nabû and Marduk —

I restored their interrupted privileged status. I wrote anew the tablet of their exemptions.

Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), governor of Babylon, king of the land of Sumer and Akkad, descendant of the eternal line of Bēl-bāni, son of Adasi, king of Assyria, precious scion of Baltil (Aššur), (one of) royal lineage (and) ancient stock —
Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), governor of Babylon, king of the land of Sumer and Akkad, selected by the steadfast heart of the god Enlil; who from his childhood trusted in the gods Aššur, Enlil, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Marduk, Nabû, Nergal, and the (other) great gods, his lords, (who) allowed him to attain his desire; (the one who) recognized their power, (the one) over whom (the gods) extended their eternal protection in order to appease their divine heart(s) and set their mind(s) at rest; (the one who) by the might of the gods Aššur, Enlil, Bēl (Marduk), and the Son-of-Bēl (Nabû), the gods, his helpers, ruled over all lands and made all rulers submissive to him; the one who (re)constructed the temple of the god Aššur, renovated Ekur, (re)built Esagil and Babylon, completed the sanctuaries and cult centers, (and) (re)confirmed (their) sattukku offerings; the king during the days of whose reign the great lord, the god Marduk, became reconciled to Babylon (and again) took up his residence in Esagil, his palace; (the one who) made the god Great-Anu enter into his city Dēr and his temple Edimgalkalama (“House, Great Bond of the Land”) and had (him) sit upon (his) eternal dais; (the one who) restored the splendid appearance of the plundered gods of the lands, returned them from Assyria to their (proper) places, and (re)confirmed their income; wise prince, expert who knows every craft, who constantly established appropriate procedures in the great cult centers (and) has purification rites performed correctly; son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria; descendant of Sargon (II), king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, (and) king of the land of Sumer and Akkad; descendant of the eternal line of Bēl-bāni, son of Adasi, king of Assyria; precious scion of Baltil (Aššur), (one of) royal lineage (and) ancient stock —
At that time, Ekur (“House, Mountain”), the temple of the god Enlil, lord of the lands, my lord, which a previous king had built, became old and its walls buckled. I sought its (original) emplacement, removed its dilapidated parts, (and) surveyed its (entire) foundation. I completely (re)built (it) with the work of the god Kulla according to its ancient specifications (and) raised its top (as high) as a mountain.
For the goddess Ištar, supreme lady, sovereign of heaven and netherworld, most valiant of the gods, splendid, the goddess Ištar of Uruk, august princess who has taken (unto herself all) divine offices of highest rank (and) has gathered to herself (all) ordinances, beloved, eminent, who looks upon the king — her favorite — with steady favor, makes his reign lengthy, (and) bestows on him power and victory, empress of the world, most exalted of the gods, who dwells in Enirgalana (“House, Prince of Heaven”) — which is inside Eanna — lady of Uruk, great lady, his lady:
Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), governor of Babylon, king of the land of Sumer and Akkad; the one to whom the god Aššur has stretched out his hand, permanently selected by the god Enlil, who was chosen by the god Marduk, favorite of the goddess Irnini; who from his childhood trusted in the gods Aššur, Anu, Enlil, Ea, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Marduk, Nabû, Nergal, and Ištar, the great gods, his lords, (who) allowed him to attain his desire, (the one who) recognized their power, (the one) over whom (the gods) extended their eternal protection in order to appease their divine heart(s) and set their mind(s) at rest; (the one who) by the might of the gods Aššur, Bēl (Marduk), the Son-of-Bēl (Nabû), and Ištar, the gods, his helpers, ruled over all lands and made all rulers submissive to him; the one who (re)constructed the temple of the god Aššur, (re)built Esagil and Babylon, renovated Eanna, completed the sanctuaries and cult centers, (and) (re)confirmed (their) sattukku offerings; the king during the days of whose reign, the great lord, the god Marduk, became reconciled to Babylon (and again) took up his residence in Esagil, his palace; the one who made the god Great-Anu enter into his city Dēr and his temple Edimgalkalama (“House, Great Bond of the Land”) and had (him) sit upon (his) eternal dais; (the one who) restored the splendid appearance of the great gods who had rushed to Assyria, returned them from Assyria to their (proper) places and (re)confirmed their income; wise prince, expert who knows every craft, who constantly established appropriate procedures in the great cult centers (and) has purification rites performed correctly; son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria; descendant of Sargon (II), king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, (and) king of the land of Sumer and Akkad; descendant of the eternal line of Bēl-bāni, son of Adasi, king of Assyria; precious scion of Baltil (Aššur), (one of) royal lineage (and) ancient stock —
Eḫiliana (“House, Luxuriance of Heaven”), the cella of the goddess Nanāya, my lady, which is inside Eanna, which a previous king had built, became old and dilapidated. I sought its (original) ground-plan (and) repaired its dilapidated parts with baked bricks from a (ritually) pure kiln. I grasped the hands of the goddess Nanāya, great lady, brought (her) inside, and caused (her) to take up residence (there) forever. I offered splendid offerings and made her doorbolt extremely fine.
(But as for) the one who erases my inscribed name by some crafty device, destroys an inscription written in my name, or changes its position, may the goddess Nanāya, supreme lady, glare at him angrily and determine a bad fate for him! May she make his name (and) his descendant(s) disappear from the land and have no pity on him!
Whoever takes away this stele from its place and erases my inscribed name and writes his name, covers (it) with dirt, throws (it) into water, burns (it) with fire, ... 
He (Esarhaddon) gave to me as my lordly share (and) as a gift the inhabitants of conquered lands, foes plundered by his bow. I made them carry hoe (and) basket, and they made bricks. 
that I had been waiting for, ... 
Moreover, I, Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria, the magnanimous one who performs acts of kindness (and) repays good deeds, had mercy on Necho, a servant who belonged to me, and forgave his crime(s). I made the treaty sworn by the gods more stringent  than the previous one and I established (it) with him.
Throughout my entire land, (on account of) abundant trade, for one shekel of silver one could purchase ten donkey-loads of grain, one homer of wine, two seahs of oil, (and) one talent of wool. Year after year, I shepherded the subjects of the god Enlil in prosperity and with justice.
Within one year, they (all) laid down (their) live(s) at the same time. The angry heart of (the god) Aššur had not relented against them, nor had the mood of the goddess Ištar, (iv 65) who had encouraged me, become tranquil towards them. They overthrew his royal dynasty. They made somebody else assume dominion over the land Elam.
(As for) Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II), for whom I performed many act(s) of kindness (and) whom I installed as king of the land Elam, (and) who forgot my favor(s), did not honor the treaty sworn by the great gods, (and) accepted bribe(s) from the hands of the messengers of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn — (my) unfaithful brother, my enemy — he sent his forces with them to fight with my troops, my battle troops who were marching about in Karduniaš (Babylonia) (and) subduing Chaldea.
My battle troops (who were stationed) in the city Mangisu — which is inside (the territory of) the city Sumandir — came up against them and brought about their defeat. They cut off the heads of Undasu, a son of Teumman — a (former) king of the land Elam — Zazaz, Parrû, (and) Atta-metu and they brought (them) before me.
I dispatched my messenger to Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II) regarding these matters. He detained the eunuch of mine whom I had sent (Marduk-šarru-uṣur) and did not give a reply to my word(s).
(As for) the sanctuaries of Assyria (and) the land Akkad whose foundation(s) Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, the father who had engendered me, had laid, but whose construction he had not finished, I myself now completed their work by the command of the great gods, my lords.
I took the gods Sîn (and) Nusku by the hand, made (them) enter into (their respective temples), (and) made (them) sit on (their) eternal dais(es).
(As for) Necho, king of the cities Memphis and Sais, Šarru-lū-dāri, king of the city Pelusium, Pi-šan-Ḫuru, king of the city Natho, Pa-qruru, king of the city (Pi)šaptu, (ii 80') Inaros (Niḫerau), king of the city Athribis, (and) Naḫkê, king of the city Heracleopolis, those kings, governors, (and) officials whom the father who had engendered me had appointed in Egypt, who had abandoned their post(s) in the face of Taharqa’s tactical advance, (and) had gone to (lit. “filled”) the countryside, 
Silver, gold, precious stones, as much property of his palace as there was, garment(s) with multi-colored trim, linen garments, large horses, people — male and female — two tall obelisks cast with shiny zaḫalû-metal, whose weight was 2,500 talents (and which) stood at a temple gate, (iii 50') I ripped (them) from where they were erected and took (them) to Assyria. I carried off substantial booty, (which was) without number, from inside the city Thebes. (iii 55') I made my weapons prevail over Egypt and Kush and (thus) achieved victory. With full hand(s), I returned safely to Nineveh, my capital city.
On my fourth campaign, I marched to the city Qirbit, which is inside (Mount) Ḫarēḫasta (lit. “the city Ḫarēḫasta”), (iv 10') since Tandāya, their city ruler, had never bowed down to the yoke of the kings, my ancestors, and the people living in the city Qirbit were constantly plundering the land Yamutbal. (iv 15') With the support of the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl (Marduk), Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, I conquered (and) plundered that city. (As for) Tandāya, their city ruler, I took (him) to Assyria together with captives from his city.
Before his messenger had arrived in his presence (and before) he could report the issuing of my decision to him, with the support of the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl (Marduk), Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nusku, (and) Nergal, who march at my side (and) kill my foes, (ix 45'') inside the land Elam, they (the Elamites) heard about the progress of the messenger of mine whom I had sent to the city Dēr... Fear of my royal majesty — with which the great gods had endowed me — overwhelmed the land Elam and (then) the people of the land Elam rebelled against Indabibi (and) (ix 50'') killed him with the sword. They placed Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), son of Atta-metu, on his (Indabibi’s) throne.
I brought out a palace woman (and) the sons of Teumman — the king of the land Elam whose head I had cut off during a previous campaign on the instruction(s) of the gods Aššur, Bēl (Marduk), (and) Nabû — together with the rest of the people living in the city Bīt-Imbî and I counted (them) as booty... third-men, ... male singers, female singers... , his ... 
Furthermore, I, Ashurbanipal, learned inside it the wisdom of the god Nabû, all of the scribal arts. I investigated the precepts of every type of scholar there is, learned how to shoot a bow, ride a horse (and) chariot, (and) take hold of (their) reins. Kings among mankind (and) lions among the animals could not grow powerful before my bow. (i 30) I know how to wage war (and) battle; I am experienced in forming a battle line (and) fighting.
After Yakīn-Lû, the king of the city Arwad, had gone to (his) fate, (ii 1) Azi-Baʾal, Abī-Baʾal, (and) Adūnī-Baʾal, the sons of Yakīn-Lû who reside in the middle of the sea, came up from the middle of the sea with their audience gift(s), and kissed my feet. (ii 5) I looked upon Azi-Baʾal with pleasure and installed (him) as king of the land Arwad. I clothed Abī-Baʾal (and) Adūnī-Baʾal in garment(s) with multi-colored trim (and) placed gold bracelets (around their wrists). I made them stand before me.
(As for) Tammarītu, who sat on the throne of the land Elam after Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II) (and) who came to the aid of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn — (my) unfaithful brother — he hastily sent his weapons to fight with my troops. As a result of the supplications that I had addressed to (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar, they accepted my prayers. Indabibi, a servant of his, rebelled against him and brought about his defeat in a pitched battle. He sat on his throne.
As for the people living inside them, I annihilated them. I smashed their gods (and thus) placated the mood of the lord of lords. I carried off to Assyria its gods, its goddesses, its possessions, (and) its property, (as well as) people, young and old. (iv 65) (Over) an area of sixty leagues, by the command that (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar had given to me, I marched about triumphantly inside the land Elam.

In its entirety, I built (and) completed Edimgalkalama, the temple of Great Anu that is inside (the city) Dēr.
The great gods, whose divinity I constantly revered, generously gr<ant>ed me power, virility, (and) outstanding strength. They placed lands that had not bowed down to me into my hands (and) allowed me to achieve my heart’s desire. I marched from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea, where the kings, my ancestors, had regularly traveled. At a distance of one month (and) twenty days (journey) into the midst of the sea and on dry land, (iv 25) I added territory to that of the kings, my ancestors, and ruled (it). I made the people living in those lands bow down to my yoke (and) imposed upon them annual tribute payment. By the command of (the god) Aššur (and) the goddess Mullissu, the kings who sit upon (royal) daises kiss my feet (and) great rulers from (both) east and west are anxious for me to be their ally.
With their radiant faces (and) the gaze of their favorable eyes, which watch over the (four) quarters (of the world), may they look with pleasure upon (me), Ashurbanipal, the king who is the favorite of their hearts, the builder of this akītu-house. May they lengthen my days (so that) I may be fully satisfied with (my) good fortune. (vi 20) May they make the foundation(s) of my royal throne endure (and) make my reign last for a long time. May they kill my enemies, (and) cut down my foes. With their great support, may I rule wherever I desire (lit. “I say”) (and) achieve whatever (lit. “the place”) I strive for.
After I had made the weapons of (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar prevail over the land Elam (and) had continually established mighty victories, on my return march, I set out towards Dunānu, a Gambulian who had put his trust in the land Elam. I conquered the city Ša-pī-Bēl, a city upon which the land Gambulu relied. (iii 55) I entered that city (and) slaughtered its people like lambs. (As for) Dunānu (and) Samgunu, the ones who had disturbed my exercising the kingship, (iii 60) I clamped (their) hands and feet in iron manacles (and) handcuffs (and) iron fetters. (As for) the rest of the sons of Bēl-iqīša, his family, the seed of his father’s house, as many as there were, Nabû-naʾid (and) Bēl-ēṭir, sons of Nabû-šuma-ēreš, the šandabakku (governor of Nippur), and the bones of the father who had engendered them (Nabû-šuma-ēreš), (iii 65) I carried (them) off together with auxiliary forces, rebels, the people of the land Gambulu, oxen, sheep and goats, donkeys, horses, (and) mules out of the land Gambulu to Assyria. (As for) Ša-pī-Bēl, the city upon which he (Dunānu) relied, I destroyed, demolished, (and) dissolved (it) with water.
Moreover, (as for) the people who had incited Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, (my) hostile brother, (so that) he performed this evil deed, who feared death, whose lives were precious to them, and who did not fall into the fire with Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, their lord, (and) those who had escaped the cut of an iron dagger, famine, starvation, (iv 60) (and) raging fire, (and) had taken refuge — the net of the great gods, my lords,  from which there is no escape, overwhelmed them. Not a single one (of them) escaped; (anyone) who tried to get away did not escape my grasp; they (the gods) placed (them) in my hands. 
After I had performed these deeds (and) pacified the heart(s) of the great gods, my lords, I brought out of Babylon, Cutha, (and) Sippar the bones of the people’s corpses that the god Erra had cut down and those who had laid down (their) live(s) from famine (and) starvation, the remnants of meal(s) for dogs (and) pigs, which were obstructing the streets (and) filling the squares, and (iv 85) I cast (them) outside. Through the craft of the purification priest, I purified their daises; I cleansed their sullied streets. Through taqribtu-ritual(s) and eršangû-ritual(s), I appeased their angry gods (and) their furious goddesses. (As for) their regular offerings, which had diminished, I confirmed (them) in full again, just as (they were) in distant days.
(As for) Uaiteʾ, along with his troops, who did not honor my treaty, who had flown away from the weapons of (the god) Aššur, my lord, (and) had fled into the presence of Natnu, the god Erra, the warrior, cut them down. Famine broke out among them and they ate the flesh of their children on account of their hunger. (ix 60) The deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Bēl (Marduk), Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, Šarrat-Kidmuri, Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nergal, (and) Nusku decreed curses, as many as were written in their treaties, accordingly upon them. 
Pislumê, the king of the land Ḫudimiri — whose location is remote (and) which is situated on the far side of the land Elam, which from distant days, in (the time of) the kings, my ancestors, it had not sent its  mounted messenger(s and) did not inquire about the well-being of their royal majesties — now (vi 20') heard about the mighty victories that, with the support  of the gods Aššur, Bēl (Marduk), and Nabû — the great gods, my lords — I had achieved over the land Elam and fear of my royal majesty overwhelmed him and he sent to Nineveh, my capital city, his mounted messenger (with a message) of peace, with his substantial audience gift(s), and he made an appeal to my lordly majesty.

After I had performed these things (and) finished (this) work, I kept the word of the father who had engendered me, (which) cannot be ... I entrusted Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, my favorite brother, with the kingship of the land Karduniaš (Babylonia), consecrated Aššur-mukīn-palēʾa, my younger brother, as šešgallu-priest of (the god) Aššur, (and) consecrated Aššur-etel-šamê-erṣetim-muballissu, my youngest brother, as šešgallu-priest of the god Sîn, who dwells in the city Ḫarrān.

Moreover, they (my troops) cut down with the sword the people of the cities, as many as had sided with them (and) plotted evil plan(s), young and old, and they did not spare a single person among them. Furthermore, they brought them (Necho and Šarru-lū-dāri) to Nineveh, my capital city, before me. 
(But) as for the one who erases my inscribed name or the name of my favorite (brother) by some crafty device, (or) destroys my royal inscription, or changes its position, may the goddess Ištar of Babylon speak evil of him before the god Bēl (and) the goddess Bēltīya (and) make his name (and) his descendant(s) disappear from the lands!

When Aššur, the lord, faithfully chose me to worship him, gave me the scepter, weapon, and staff to (rule) properly the black-headed people, and granted me the true crown of lordship; at that time, at the beginning of my vice-regency, the land Uruaṭri rebelled against me.

I conquered nine of his fortified cult centers (as well as) the city from which he ruled and I turned 180 of his cities into ruin hills.

At that time, at the beginning of my sovereignty, I cleared away its earth down to the bottom of the foundation pit. I rebuilt the holy temple, her joyful dwelling, a perfect shrine, (and) her restful dais; I made them (lit. “which were”) more outstanding than before. I completed (it) from top to bottom and deposited my monumental inscriptions.

I conquered the lands of the Papḫu (and) Uqumanu as far as the lands Šarnida (and) Meḫru. Annually I regularly received the tribute of their lands and the produce of their mountains. (As) with a bridle I controlled the lands Katmuḫu, Buššu, Alzu, Madanu, Niḫanu, Alaia, Tepurzu, Purulumzu, (and) the entire land of the extensive Šubaru. I subdued at my feet the kings, their leaders, and imposed (upon them) corvée. With my surpassingly strong might I frequently traversed mighty mountains (and) extremely difficult ranges, the paths of which no other king knew. I cut into their mountains with copper picks (and) widened their impassable paths. I did battle with forty kings of the lands Nairi (and) brought about the defeat of their army. (Thus) I became lord of all their lands. I fastened bronze clasps to the necks of those same kings of the lands Nairi (and) brought them to Ekur, the great mountain, the temple of my support, into the presence of the god Aššur, my lord. I made them swear by the great gods of heaven (and) underworld (and) levied upon them tribute and impost forever.
The prince who accepts their gifts, the shepherd who has charge over them, and the herdsman who properly administers them, I:
That which (was engraved) upon a seal of lapis lazuli.

I turned into ruin hills (and) carried off their booty ... 
The palace of Aššur-rēša-iši, strong king, king of the universe, king of Assyria:
(builder) of the courtyard of the palace ... 
I overwhelmed the city Ḫunusu, their fortified city, (so that it looked) like a ruin hill (created by) the deluge. Violently I fought (vi 1) with their mighty army in city and mountain (and) brought about their defeat. (vi 5) I laid low their men-at-arms in the mountains like sheep. Like lambs I cut off their heads (and) made their blood flow into the hollows and plains of the mountains. (Thus) I conquered that city. I took their gods (and) (vi 10) brought out their booty, possessions, (and) property. I burnt the city. The three walls which were constructed with baked brick and the entire city I razed, destroyed, turned into a ruin hill and (vi 15) strewed ṣīpu-stones over it. I made bronze lightning bolts (and) inscribed on them (a description of) the conquest of the lands which with the god Aššur, my lord, I conquered (and a warning) not to occupy that city and not to rebuild its wall. On that (site) I built a house of baked brick and put inside those bronze lightning bolts.
Offspring of Ninurta-apil-ekur, martial sovereign, loved one of the god Aššur, whose wings were spread like an eagle's over his land and who faithfully tended the people of Assyria:
With cedar and beams, which by the command of the gods Aššur and Anu, the great gods, my lords — (after) I had marched to Mount Lebanon — I had cut down, carried off, (and) installed (these) excellent beams in the temple of the gods Anu and Adad, the great gods, my lords: with the remains of the cedar I constructed the house of those šaḫūru from top to bottom. I entirely surrounded it with basalt slabs. I constructed the house of the labūnu, before (which) it (stands), of terebinth from top to bottom. I entirely surrounded it with white limestone slabs. (Thus) I constructed, completed, (and) decorated this palace in a splendid fashion with cedar and terebinth.
This cedar palace I built with understanding and skill (and) called it Egallugalšarrakurkurra, “Palace of the King of All Lands”. I made it fitting for my royal residence for eternity. As the former palaces — into which princes who preceded me, older kings down to my time, who constructed such palaces and (made them fitting) for royal residences for eternity, would invite inside the god Aššur, my lord, and the great gods at the festivals of their city and make sacrifices ... — (as) those palaces were not consecrated or designated as divine residences but when a prince/king built a palace, his gods would come inside (and) he would present therein sacrifices to the gods: as the numerous palaces, which the kings who preceded me did not consecrate or designate as divine residences, this cedar palace, first/one year, palace of the god Aššur, my lord, and the great gods ... eternity, sacrifices were made before them (although) this palace was not consecrated or designated as a divine residence — the king and his ... dwell therein.
On this campaign of mine I marched to the land Sūḫu. I conquered from the city Sabiritu, an island in the Euphrates, the cities on this bank and the far bank as far as the city Ḫindānu. I uprooted their people, carried off their gods, (and) brought (all of) them to my city Aššur.

I burnt, razed, (and) destroyed (them), (and) brought their booty, possessions, and goods to my city Aššur.

I flayed the men, their city-rulers, ... Over against their numerous cities I built into mounds the corpses of their warriors which I had felled with the sword in the battlefield ...

The king, my lord, has revived the one who was guilty and condemned to death; you have released the one who was imprisoned for many years. Those who were sick for many days have got well, the hungry have been sated, the parched have been anointed with oil, the needy have been covered with garments.

As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: "Has any curse  been written there?" — 
The king, my lord, should not be worried about it.
If it should occur, what is the word about it?" — the 14th  day (signifies) the Eastland, the month Sivan (III) (signifies) the  Westland, and the relevant 'decision' (pertains) to Ur. And if it occurs, the (interpretation concerning the) region it afflicts and the  wind blowing will be quoted as well.

Concerning the crown prince about whom the king, my lord, wrote  to me: "I have been told that he should not go outdoors on the 1st  day" — this applies (rather) to the 2nd day.
They did not tell me about the charge of the house of Urad-Daguna, when I was there; now, however, I have entered (the house) and examined (his) flesh. Is there a child who does not behave in this way (sometimes)?
Concerning Nergal-šarrani and his brother Nabû-nadin-šumi about whom the king, my lord, gave me orders, I have hearkened to it ten times  with all my ability.
Yesterday I performed the ritual of Bīt rimki. I made a burnt-offering and we executed a purification ritual.

This aforesaid is the only area which is taken as bad if Jupiter  retrogrades there. Wherever else it might turn, it may freely do so,  there is not a word about it. Perhaps it was about this that the servant  of the king, when (still) alive, and I spoke in the presence of the  king, my lord. Saturn will 'push itself' this very month. (But) there is  definitely not a word about it anywhere.
Subsequently I am sending off (an assortment of) drugs for fumigation. The kanaktu and nikiptu oil which I dispatched should be first dripped into the ear, thereafter let them do the fumigation. As soon as they have fumigated, they should repeat (the procedure), drip the rest of the oil upon (a tuft of) red wool and insert it into the ear. It is very efficient.

As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: "Is it good for Aššur-mukin-paleya to come up into my presence, and Sin-per'u-ukin to come up with him? Can the latter join him? They are (now) separated" —
The king, my lord, is the chosen one of the great gods; the shadow of the king, my lord, is pleasant for everything.

May the king, my lord, see them prosper, and may their grandchildren in like manner run around in the presence of the king, my lord!

To the mother of the king, my lord: your servant  Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the mother of the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the mother of the king, my lord!
Šumma izbu is difficult to interpret. The first time that I come before the king, my lord, I shall (personally) show, with this tablet that I am sending to the king, my lord, how the omen is written.
The king should not be afraid of this eclipse! The planets Jupiter, Venus and Saturn were present during the eclipse.

I observed the (crescent of the) moon on the 30th day, but it was high, too high to be (the crescent) of the 30th. Its position was like that of the 2nd day. If it is acceptable to the king, my lord, let the king wait for the report of the Inner City before fixing the date.

Concerning the watch for a lunar eclipse about which the king, my  lord, wrote to me — its watch will be (kept) on the decided night; (but)  whether its watch should be during sunset, we have not been able to  decide.
I have  already started with it (but) I am waiting for ...
