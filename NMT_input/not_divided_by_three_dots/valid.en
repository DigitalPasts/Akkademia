Palace of Shalmaneser (V), king of Assyria: one-fourth (mina) of the king.
The gods Aššur, Nabû, (and) Marduk, the gods, my helpers, granted me a reign without equal and exalted my good reputation to the heights.
In days to come, may a future ruler among the kings, my descendants, renovate (any) dilapidated sections of this palace. May he (then) discover my inscribed object, anoint (it) with oil, offer a sacrifice, (and) return (it) to its (original) place. The god Aššur will (then) listen to his prayers.

I ordered that a sanctuary be constructed within it for the god Šamaš, the great judge of the great gods, the one who makes me triumph.
At their august command, I built a palace using (lit.: “of”) elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, daprānu-juniper, and terebinth to be my royal residence; I fashioned a bīt-ḫilāni, a replica of a Hittite palace, in front of their gates and roofed them with beams of cedar (and) cypress.
Moving on from the city Ulḫu, I came to the village(s) of the land, the foremost of the fortified cities of the district Sangibutu. (This is) an inhabited district seized by his (Rusâ’s) land, which long ago earlier king(s), his predecessors, had annexed in order to expand their country.

They are clothed in terror for the doing of battle. Deep moats were dug around them for the support ... and towers were constructed at the approaches to their gates.

At that time, (with regard to) the juniper palace in the city Kalḫu that Ashurnasirpal (II), a prince who preceded me had previously built, the foundations of this house had not been made strong and its foundations had not been secured upon firm ground, (on) bedrock. (15) It had become old (and) dilapidated  (lit.: “dilapidated (and) old”) due to downpours of rain; its footing had dissolved and its bondings given way. I identified its (former) location and reached the bottom of its foundation pit. I piled up its foundation terrace upon heavy limestone blocks like the base of a high mountain. I completely (re)constructed (it) from its foundations to its crenellations. I opened up an air passage to the left of its door for my pleasure. I depicted inside it (the palace) the conquest of cities, the triumph of my weapons, that I had achieved over the enemy, and I filled it with abundance for the inspection (of the people).
In the course of my campaign ... I received from 45 city rulers of the powerful Medes 8,609 horses ... 
I created around it a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, in which were gathered every kind of fruit-bearing mountain tree.

My princely predecessor had become angry with Ḫullî, king of the land Bīt-Purutaš, and ... had commanded the dissolution of his land.

Fear of the brilliance of the gods Aššur, Nabû, (and) Marduk, my lords, overwhelmed him (the king of Meluḫḫa) and he put iron fetters on his (Iāmānī’s) hands and feet. (ii' 5) He then had him brought in bondage to Assyria, into my presence. I reorganized (the administration of) those cities. I settled there people from the lands in the eastern mountains that I had conquered. (ii' 10) I set a eunuch of mine as provincial governor over them and imposed the yoke of my lordship upon them.

The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.
When they reported his (Marduk-apla-iddina’s) evil deeds to me, Sennacherib, the attentive man of the steppe, I raged up like a lion and ordered the march into Babylon to confront him. He (Marduk-apla-iddina), the (very) image of an evil gallû-demon, heard about the advance of my expeditionary force, then he reinforced their companies with horses (and) Elamite, Aramean, (and) Chaldean archers, together with Nergal-nāṣir and ten unit commanders of the king of the land Elam who did not know (fear of) death, (and) the countless forces who were with them. He brought their contingents together in Cutha and had (them) keep watch at outposts for the approach of my expeditionary force. 
I defeated Tannānu, together with the Elamite, Chaldean, and Aramean troops who had stood by him and had come to his aid, and I scattered his forces. I captured alive Adinu, a nephew of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), together with Basqānu, a brother of Iatiʾe, queen of the Arabs, along with their troops. I seized the chariots, wagons, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, (and) Bactrian camels that he had abandoned during the battle.

I appointed over them Bēl-ibni, a son of a rab banî (and) a scion of Šuanna (Babylon) who had grown up like a young puppy in my palace, as king of the land of Sumer and Akkad.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial audience gift from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats. 
I engraved on large limestone slabs (images of) the enemy settlements that I had conquered. I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses (with them and) made (them) an object of wonder.
I appointed over them Bēl-ibni, a son of a rab banî (and) a scion of Šuanna (Babylon) who had grown up like a young puppy in my palace, as king of the land of Sumer and Akkad.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats without number and brought them to nought. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and hung their corpses on towers around the city; I counted the citizens who had committed the criminal acts as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of crimes or wrongdoing, (to) whom no penalty was due, be allowed to go free.
... its foundations ... 
(As for) the one who alters my inscribed object (and) disrespects my words, may (the god) Aššur, king of the gods, and the great gods of heaven and netherworld curse him with a harsh, irreversible curse, and may they overthrow his kingship, deprive him of his life, (and) eradicate his name, his seed, his offspring, (and) his progeny from the mouth of the people.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Maliḫu (Malaḫu), Gurumu, (i 25') Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, (i 30')  insubmissive Arameans. I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. (ii 30'') I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
They quarried mountain sheep colossi of white limestone in the city Tastiate, which is across the Tigris River, to be their (the palatial halls’) gatekeepers. Throughout their entire land they depleted forests of large trees to have boats built. (v 60) In the month Ayyāru (II), the time of spring floods, they brought (the colossi) across to this side (of the river) with difficulty in magnificent boats. They sank large boats at the quay dock (and then) made their crews struggle (and) strain. (v 65) With might and main, they struggled to transport (the colossi) and install (them) in their gates.
I had a palace of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, and elammaku-wood, (vi 45) (a palace that I named) Egalzagdinutukua (“The Palace Without a Rival”), constructed thereon as my royal residence.
I covered ten sphinxes of cast bright urudû-copper with shining zaḫalû-silver and (over them), over ten sphinxes of alabaster, (and) over twelve sphinxes of cast ... -metal I erected two magnificent ebony columns, whose inlays are pašallu-gold, and columns of cedar, cypress, (and) daprānu-juniper (vi 75) with ešmarû-silver and bronze inlays, and I positioned the architraves of my lordly palatial halls (on those columns).
Moreover, I made twelve mountain sheep colossi of cast bright urudû-copper, which are splendid in form (and) perfect in shape, (vii 1) two mountain sheep colossi of alabaster, (and) seventy-two mountain sheep colossi and sphinxes of white limestone suitable for holding the door bolt(s) for leaving and entering.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. With the support of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and defeated them. (iii 55) In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
Moreover, (as for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified cities, fortresses, and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, by having ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, (iv 1) the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
I pursued them on the peaks of the mountains and defeated them. I conquered, (v 10) plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.
Twelve striding lions of shining copper (and) fierce demeanor, (which were) standing opposite one another, which were skillfully cast through the craftsmanship of the god Ninagal, and which were filled with radiance — upon (those) lion colossi I installed two identical columns that were cast from bronze, (vi 80) together with four large cedar columns, and I positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
“The God Adad Is the Provider of Prosperity to the Land”: (this is) the Adad Gate, which (leads to) the game preserve. “The God Erra Is the One Who Cuts Down Enemies”: (this is) the Nergal Gate, which (leads to) the city Tarbiṣu. “The God Igisigsig Is the One Who Makes Orchards Flourish”: (vii 60) (this is) the Gate of the Gardens. In total, three gates (facing) towards the north (and) I gave them (these) names.
Moreover, I conquered thirty-five cities on the borders of its outskirts and carried off people, oxen, and sheep and goats, (and) donkeys. (Then) I destroyed (them), devastated (them), (and) burned (them) with fire.
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, (v 50) the performing of this work came to my attention by the will of the gods and I put my mind to it. I forcibly removed the people of Chaldea, Aramean (tribes), the land of the Manneans, the lands Que and Ḫilakku, (and) Philistia, and the land (of the city) Tyre, who had not submitted to my yoke, then I made them carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks.
I fastened bands of copper and tin on magnificent copper columns, as well as on large cedar columns, which are the product of Mount Amanus, then I installed (them) upon lion colossi and positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly. 
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron ... 
On my return march, I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son (whom I) raised on my (own) knee, on his lordly throne and

I created a marsh to moderate the flow of those waters and planted a canebrake in it. (viii 10'') I let loose in it herons, wild boars (lit. “pigs of the reeds”), (and) roe deer. By divine will, vines, all kinds of fruit trees, olive trees, (and) aromatic trees flourished greatly in (those) gardens (planted) on newly tilled soil. (Cypress trees, musukkannu-trees, and) all kinds of trees grew tall and sent out shoots. The marshes thrived greatly. (viii 15'') Birds of the heavens, herons whose home(s) are far away, made nest(s) and wild boars (and) roe deer gave birth in abundance.

On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and (ii 40) he fled afar into the midst of the sea and disappeared. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, Bīt-Zitti, Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) (ii 45) and water-place(s), resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet. 
I roofed them with magnificent beams of cedar grown on Mount Amanus, the holy mountain. I fastened bands of bright copper on doors of white cedar and I installed (them) in their gates. I had magnificent bull colossi fashioned from white limestone that was discovered in the territory of the city Balāṭāya and on the right and left I made (them) hold their door bolts.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
I raged up like a lion, then put on armor (and) placed a helmet suitable for combat on my head. (v 60) In my anger, I rode quickly in my exalted battle chariot, which lays enemies low. I took in my hand the mighty bow that the god Aššur had granted to me (and) I grasped in my hand an arrow that cuts off life.
In the future, one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar name for shepherding the land and (vi 55) people — when that palace becomes old and dilapidated, may a future ruler renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that palace becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
... (... ) (As for) the rest of his magnates, including Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), who had raised their arms because they were terrified of doing battle with me, I captured them alive in the thick of battle. 
I took away the kingship of Lulî, the king of the city Sidon. (i 10') I placed Tu-Baʾlu on his throne and imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship. 
I struck down with the sword the people of the land Ḫilakku, who live in the mountains. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.
With the ingenious mind that the lord of wisdom, the god Ninšiku, had granted to me, by divine will, I created clay molds for all of the bronze works that I intended to cast in Nineveh for the requirements of my palatial halls, then I poured copper into them (text “it”) and (80) my handiwork succeeded. Furthermore, I had twin lamassu-colossi of copper bear slabs of pendû-stone. I stationed (them) between the sphinxes, made (them) like battlements, and made (the façade) beautiful.
... I captured the people of his land and counted (them) as booty. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his cities.
At the time of the festival of the akītu-house (New Year’s house), I celebrate annually inside it with prayer and expressions of my humility (lit. “stroking my nose”) before god and goddess and for my lordly pleasure.
I built palatial halls of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, (and) elammaku-wood there­on as my lordly residence; (then) I had a portico, a replica of a Hittite palace, constructed opposite (its) gates. 
In> the uplands of Mount Ammanāna (northern Anti-Lebanon), they (Aššur and Ištar) disclosed to me the location of alabaster, which in the time of the kings, my ancestors, was too expensive (even) for the pommel of a sword. 
I made those palatial halls beautiful. To be an object of wonder for all of the people, I raised the superstructure of the entire palace. I called it the “Palace Without a Rival.”
The god Aššur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all of the rulers and he made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. 
In a pitched battled in the plain of Kish, I repulsed Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), (and) took away his rulership. I killed with the sword all of the Chaldeans, together with the massed body of Elamite troops, his allies.
Sphinxes of alabaster, as well as sphinxes of cast urudû-copper that were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, and sphinxes of cast ... -metal, whose features were brilliant: I erected over them columns of ebony, cypress, cedar, daprānu-juniper, juniper, and tatīdu-wood, with pašallu-gold and silver inlays, and (then) I positioned the architraves of the inner rooms of my lordly residence (on those columns). 
The palace in the citadel of Nineveh, whose extent was 360 cubits on (its) longer side (and) 95 cubits on (its) shorter side, and whose site was too small; (and) which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly and that my handiwork be completed, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar, who love my priestly service (and) who selected me (lit. “who called my name”), revealed to me a source of trunks of cedar, which since distant days grew tall and very thick as they stood in seclusion in the Sirāra mountain range.
By the command of the god Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Ištar, the queen, may the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu last forever and ever in that palace. May they never leave it.
In a pitched battled, I repulsed Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), (and) took away his rulership. I killed with the sword all of the Chaldeans, together with the massed body of Elamite troops, his allies.
At that time, I made the enemy people whom I had captured carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks.
I ruined the wide district of the ... land Judah (and) ... 
I entered his palace, which is in Babylon, and (then) I opened his treasury and carried off gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, the possessions (and) property of his palace.
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. I set up blockades against him. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered and I gave (them) to the kings of the cities Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, (and) Gaza, and (thereby) made his land smaller. To the former tribute, their annual giving, I added the payment (of) gifts and imposed (it) upon them.
The god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I ordered the march against them, to the land Nagītu. I settled in Nineveh the people of the land Ḫatti plundered by my bow(s) and they skillfully built magnificent ships, a product characteristic of their land. I gave orders to sailors of the cities Tyre (and) Sidon, (and) the land Ionia, whom I had captured. They (my troops) let (the sailors) sail down the Tigris River with them downstream to the city Opis.
They quarried bull colossi of white limestone in the city Tastiate to be their (the palatial halls’) gatekeepers. Throughout all of their lands they depleted forests of large trees to have boats built. In the month Ayyāru (II), the time of spring floods, they brought (the colossi) across to this side (of the river) with difficulty in magnificent boats. They sank large boats at the quay dock (and then) made their crews struggle (and) strain. With might and main, they struggled to transport (the colossi) and install (them) in their gates.
By divine will, I created clay mold(s) of tree trunks and date palm(s), the tree of abundance, (of) twelve raging lions, as well as (of) twelve magnificent bull colossi with perfect features (and) twenty-two sphinxes that are coated in allure and charm (and) that have pride (and) exuberance heaped upon them, and I poured copper into it. Just like the cast work of (an object weighing only) a half shekel, I perfected their form(s).
Sphinxes of alabaster, as well as sphinxes of cast urudû-copper that were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, and sphinxes of cast ... -metal, whose features were brilliant:  I erected over them columns of ebony, cypress, cedar, daprānu-juniper, juniper, and Indian wood, with pašallu-gold and silver inlays, and (then) I positioned the architraves of the inner rooms of my lordly residence (on those columns). 
Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria: I had tall cedar columns, which I had had hauled up from the Tigris River, loaded on sled(s) and dragged along a canal.
Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, built a palace anew inside Nineveh.
Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, built the wall of Nineveh anew.
Palace of Sennacherib, king of Assyria. Whoever erases my inscribed name (or) places (it) in the service of a god (or another) person, may (the god) Aššur make his name (and) his seed disappear.
Afterwards, I decided to increase the height of the terrace, and (then) I built up 20 courses of brick to the former (terrace) and (thus) I raised (it) to a (total) height of 180 courses of brick... I made the area larger than before, added (it) to the former dimensions of the palace, and (thus) enlarged its structure.
I received gold (and) shining silver sling straps from their wrists (and) slashed off their belts with sharp swords. I took away gold (and) silver (decorated) belt-daggers from their waists. 
(As for) any future ruler who ... changes and ... by some crafty device, erases ... , may the deities Aššur, Anu, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, ... all of the gods of Assyria,  make their name, their seed, their offspring, (and) their progeny disappear ... 
Whoever erases my inscribed name (or) places (it) in the service of a god or (another) person, may the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Ištar, (and) ... make his name (and) his seed disappear.
Through divination, at the command of the gods Šamaš and Adad, I built the akītu-house of the steppe for the qerītu-festival, which had been forgotten for a long time. I named it Eabbaugga, “House (where) Tiāmat Is Put to Death.” I named its cella Edubdubabba, “House that Makes the Host of Tiāmat Tremble.”
... to my land ... 
By the exalted command of the god Aššur, the great lord, the father of the gods, the one who decrees fates, inside the palace ... may I attain old age, which without ... , (and) be sated with happiness. 
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, and (then) I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians who had fled from my weapons and I made (them) dwell in the cities Ḫardišpu (and) Bīt-Kubatti. I placed them under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Arrapḫa. I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city. 
Palace of Sleep, a restful tomb, the eternal dwelling of Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria.
Its images ... in the gates ... the gate ... 
Moreover, I struck with the sword the soldiers of the enemy, a recalcitrant force who had not submitted quickly to my yoke, and hung (their corpses) on poles. 
The deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Ninurta, and Ištar, the great gods who stand at the side of the king, their favorite, and make his weapons prevail over all enemies:
Then, ... I had a stele made and had written (on it) the mighty victories of (the god) Aššur, my lord. I erected (it) for ever after on the peak of Mount Nipur, where ... 
At that time ... I marched quickly to Babylon and ... , the king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), who ... 
As soon as I had completed the temples (and) had installed (them) on their daises as (their) eternal dwelling(s), with their great help I marched triumphantly from the rising sun to the setting sun and I had no rival (therein). I made the rulers of the four quarters bow down at my feet (and) they (the gods) entrusted to me (any) land that had sinned against the god Aššur.
I crushed the wicked Barnaki, who live in the land Tīl-Ašurri, which is called Pitānu in the language of the people of the land Miḫrānu.
The Elamites (and) Gutians, obstinate rulers, who used to answer the kings, my ancestors, with hostility, heard of what the might of the god Aššur, my lord, had done among all of (my) enemies, and fear and terror poured over them. So that there would be no trespassing on the borders of their countries they sent their messengers (with messages) of friendship and peace to Nineveh, before me, and they swore an oath by the great gods. 
In a favorable month, on a propitious day, I built great palatial halls upon that terrace for my lordly residence. (vi 5) I built a royal house ninety-five large cubits long (and) thirty-one large cubits wide, something none of the kings, my ancestors, had done. I had its lower courses surrounded with limestone paving stones and I roofed it with magnificent cedar beams. 
Month “Opening of the Door,” eponymy of Atar-ili, governor of the land Laḫīru (673 BC). 
By the command of the god Aššur, the king of the gods, and the gods of Assyria, all of them, let me dwell in it forever in good health, happiness, bright spirit(s), (and) with the satisfaction of growing old, and let me be sated with its splendor. At new year, in the first month, yearly, without ceasing, let me inspect in it all of the thoroughbreds, mules, donkeys, camels, military equipment, implements of war, (and) (vi 35) all of the captured enemy soldiers. Let the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu, who guard my royal path (and) who make me happy, last forever and ever in that palace. May they never leave it.
At that time, the armory of Nineveh which the kings who came before (me), my ancestors, had built to maintain the camp (and) to keep thoroughbreds, mules, chariots, military equipment, implements of war, and (iv 35') the plunder of enemies, everything that the god Aššur, king of the gods, gave me as my royal share — that place had become too small for me to have horses show their mettle (and) to train with chariots. 
In my second campaign, (as for) Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, (who) did not fear my lordship (and) did not listen to the words of my lips, who trusted in the rolling sea and threw off the yoke of the god Aššur — I leveled Sidon, his stronghold, which is situated in the midst of the sea, like a flood, tore out its wall(s) and its dwelling(s), and threw (them) into the sea; and I (even) made the site where it stood disappear.
Moreover, Sanda-uarri, king of the cities Kundi and Sissû, a dangerous enemy, who did not fear my lordship (and) abandoned the gods, (ii 40') trusted in the impregnable mountains. He (and) Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, agreed to help one another, swore an oath by their gods with one another, and trusted in their own strength. I trusted in the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, and Nabû, (ii 45') the great gods, my lords, besieged him, caught him like a bird from the midst of the mountains, and cut off his head. “In Tašrītu (VII) — the head of Abdi-Milkūti! In  Addaru (XII) — the head of Sanda-uarri!” I beheaded (both) in the same year: With the former I did not delay, (... )
I plundered the land Bīt-Dakkūri, which is in Chaldea, an enemy of Babylon. I captured Šamaš-ibni, its king, a rogue (and) outlaw, (i' 5') who did not respect the oath of the lord of lords, who took away fields of the citizens of Babylon and Borsippa by force and turned (them) over to himself. Because I know the fear of the gods Bēl and Nabû, I returned those fields and entrusted (them) to the citizens of Babylon and Borsippa. I placed Nabû-šallim, son of Balāssu, on his throne and he (now) pulls my yoke.

The king, who with the help of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Nabû, Marduk, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, marched freely from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and made all of his enemies and the rulers who were unsubmissive to him bow down at his feet; the one who conquered the city Sidon, which is in the midst of the sea, (and) the one who leveled all of its dwellings; (15) the one who plundered the city Arzâ, which is in the neighborhood of the Brook of Egypt, (and) who threw Asuḫīli, its king, into fetters along with his counselors (and) brought (them) to Assyria; moreover, (I am) the one who struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian, together with his entire army, in the territory of the land Ḫubušna; the one who treads on the unsubmissive people of Cilicia;
I had a foundation inscription written in my name and written in the name of Ashurbanipal, the senior son of the king, who (resides in) the House of Succession, my beloved son, and placed (this inscription) in it.
... when that palace becomes old and dilapidated... and may he anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) place (it) with an inscription written in his name. The god Ninurta, son of the god Enlil, will (then) hear his prayers. 
Palace of Esarhaddon, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria.
The one who crushed the Barnaki, a dangerous enemy, who live in the land Tīl-Ašurri, which is called Pitānu in the language of the people of the land Miḫrānu; the one who scattered the Mannean people, undisciplined Gutians — (as for) the land Patušarri, a district in the area of the salt desert, which is in the midst of the land of the distant Medes, borders Mount Bikni, (and) upon the soil of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had walked, I carried off to Assyria Šidir-parna (and) E-parna, mighty chieftains, who were not submissive to (my) yoke, together with their people (and) their heavy plunder. 
Later, Hazael died and I placed Iautaʾ (Iataʾ), his son, on his throne. I imposed upon him tribute and payment greater than the payment I fixed on his father. Uabu, who ... my ... , took for himself the kingship of Iautaʾ... I sent my officials (and) my battle troops to the aid of Iautaʾ ... and ...

I had its bricks made for a whole year in brickmolds of ivory, ebony, boxwood, (and) musukkannu-wood. I built anew (and) completed Esagil, the palace of the gods, together with its shrines, from its foundations to its battlements. I made (it) greater than before, raised (it) up, glorified (it), (and) made (it) glisten like the stars (lit. “writing”) of the firmament. I filled (it) with splendor (making it) an object of wonder for all of the people.
I am the one who (re)built Babylon,  (re)constructed Esagil, renewed (it) gods and goddesses, completed (its) shrines, (re)confirmed  (its) sattukku offerings, (and) who gathered its (Babylon’s) scattered people.
I restored order to the disturbances at Kish and made light shine forth for the confused people.
Let me enlarge my family, gather my relatives, (and) extend my progeny so that they branch out widely; let him (the god Marduk) make the foundation of the throne of my priestly office be as secure as a great mountain; let my reign endure as long as heaven and earth; let me stride beaming daily in joy, gladness, happiness, shining face, (and) happy mood; (and) let a happy fate, a good fate, (one) for the lengthening of the days of my reign, the protection of the throne of my priestly office, (and) the well-being of my offspring be placed in their (the gods’) mouths.
May he (the god Marduk) make his name (and) his descendant(s) disappear from the land. May he have no pity on him forever.
I refurbished the statues of the great gods (and) I had (them) dwell on their daises as an eternal dwelling. I (re)confirmed their interrupted sattukku offerings.

The great gods in their assembly determined a favorable destiny as my lot (and) they granted me a broad mind (and) allowed my mind to learn all of the scribal arts. They glorified the mention of my name in the assembly of princes (lit. “stags”) (and) made my kingship great; they generously granted me power, virility, (and) outstanding strength; (and) they placed lands that had not bowed down to me into my hands (and) allowed me to achieve my heart’s desire. 
(As for) Taharqa, in the place where he had fled, the awesome terror of the weapon of (the god) Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed him and he passed away.
(As for) Andaria, the governor of the land Urarṭu, who had advanced (and) marched during the night to conquer the cities Uppumu and Kullimmeri, the people living in the city Kullimmeri, servants who belonged to me, inflicted a heavy defeat on him during the night. They did not spare anyone. They cut off the head of Andaria and they brought (it) to Nineveh, before me.
(As for) Marduk-šuma-ibni, his (Urtaku’s) eunuch, the instigator who had incited Urtaku to plot evil (deeds), the god Marduk, the king of the gods, imposed his grievous punishment upon him.
Teumman constantly sought out evil (deeds),
(As for) Iautaʾ, hardship befell him and he fled alone. 
I skillfully made a bed of musukkannu-wood ... as a pleasure bed for the god Bēl (Marduk) (and) the goddess Bēltīya (Zarpanītu) to carry out the wedding (and) to make love. I placed (it) in Kaḫilisu, the bed chamber of the goddess Zarpanītu, which is laden with sexual charm.
I set up ... in the gateway(s) of Egallammes, the temple of the god Nergal of the city Tarbiṣu.
Throughout my entire land, (on account of) abundant trade, for one shekel of silver one could purchase ten donkey-loads of grain, three homers of wine, two seahs of oil, (and) one talent of wool. Year after year, I shepherded the subjects of the god Enlil in prosperity and with justice.
Throughout my entire land, (on account of) abundant trade, for one shekel of silver one could purchase twelve donkey-loads of grain, three homers of wine, two seahs of oil, (and one) talent of wool. Year after year, I shepherded the subjects of the god Enlil in prosperity and with justice.
(As for) Nabû-šuma-ēreš, the šandabakku (governor of Nippur) who did not honor (my) treaty, he suffered from dropsy, (that is) “full water.”
(As for) the rest of the brothers of Dunānu and Aplāya, I killed (them), chopped up their flesh, (and) sent (them) out to be a spectacle in all of the lands.
(As for) Iautaʾ, hardship befell him and he fled alone to the land of the Nabayateans. 
I skillfully made a bed of musukkannu-wood, a durable wood, that is clad with pašallu-gold (and) studded with precious stones, as a pleasure bed for the god Bēl (Marduk) and the goddess Bēltīya (Zarpanītu) to carry out the wedding (and) to make love. I placed (it) in Kaḫilisu, the bed chamber of the goddess Zarpanītu, which is laden with sexual charm.
The great gods, whose divinity I constantly revered, generously granted me power, virility, (and) outstanding strength. They placed lands that had not bowed down to me into my hands (and) allowed me to achieve my heart’s desire. (i 95') I marched from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea, where the kings, my ancestors, had regularly traveled. At a distance of one month (and) twenty days (journey) into the midst of the sea and on dry land, I added territory to that of the kings, my ancestors, and ruled (it). I made the people living in those lands bow down to my yoke (and) imposed annual tribute payment upon them. (i 100') By the command of (the god) Aššur (and) the goddess Ištar, the kings who sit upon (royal) daises kiss my feet (and) great rulers from (both) east and west are anxious for me to be their ally.
With the support of (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar, I conquered that city (Thebes) in its entirety.
(As for) the Cimmerians, a dangerous enemy who had never feared my ancestors, and, with regard to me, had not grasped the feet of my royal majesty, with the support of (the god) Aššur (and) the goddess Ištar, my lords, he (Gyges) clamped (them) in manacles, handcuffs, (and) neck-stocks and sent (them) before me, together with his substantial audience gift(s).
(As for) Urtaku, the king of the land Elam who had not respected my friendship, whom death called on a day (that was) not his fate, who came to an end (and) withered away while wailing  — he no (longer) set foot upon the land of the living. In that year, his life came to an end (and) he passed away.
On my eighth campaign, I marched against Dunānu, son of Bēl-iqīša, to the land Gambulu, which had put its trust in the king of the land Elam (and) had not bowed down to my yoke. With my mighty battle array, I covered the land Gambulu in its entirety like a fog. I conquered the city Ša-pî-Bēl, his fortified city, whose location is situated between rivers.
(As for) Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, ... , whom I had installed as king ... , he severed the peace (that was between us) ... the city gates of Babylon. Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II), (... ) a servant who belonged to me, whom I had installed as king in the land Elam, incited him to become hostile towards me and to cast off the yoke of my lordship. He took away the property of Esagil and Ezida and sent (it) ... 
(As for) the soldiers who had perpetrated sedition (and) rebellion, as many as had made common cause with him, not a single one (of them) escaped; (anyone) who tried to get away did not escape my grasp. (viii 65') (As for) clothing (and) precious jewelry, every royal appurtenance, the necessities of his palace, as much as there was, his palace women, his nobles, his eunuchs, and (other) people associated with his palace, silver, gold, possessions, property, (viii 70') chariot(s), a processional carriage, the vehicle of his lordly majesty, horses, his harness-broken (steeds), (and) people — male and female, young and old — who had escaped from the clash of arms, diʾu-disease, plague, pestilence, and hunger — I captured (them and) carried (them) off to Assyria.
(As for) the people and the booty of the land Elam, which I had plundered by the command of the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl (Marduk), Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, Šarrat-Kidmuri, Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta, and Nergal — (ix 55''b) I gave the best (of them) to my gods. I conscripted archers, shield bearers, ... (and) added (them) to my royal contingent. I divided up the rest like sheep and goats among my governors, my nobles, my cult centers, ... , (and) my ... 
Afterwards, Necho, Šarru-lū-dāri, (and) Pa-qruru sinned against my treaty (and) did not honor the oath(s sworn) by the great gods. They forgot my kindness and their heart(s) plotted evil (deeds). They spoke word(s) of treachery and decided (among) themselves on a profitless decision, saying: (ii 20') “If they remove Taharqa from Egypt, how then can we (ourselves) stay?” To establish treaties and peace, they dispatched their mounted messenger(s) to Taharqa, the king of Kush, saying: “Let peace be established between us so that (ii 25') we can come to a mutual agreement. (Let) us divide the land among ourselves so that no other lord comes between us.” With regard to troops of Assyria, the might of my lordly majesty, they constantly sought out evil plan(s) to cut (their) throat(s).
On my eighth campaign, I marched against Dunānu, son of Bēl-iqīša, to the land Gambulu, which had put its trust in the king of the land Elam (vii 15') (and) had not bowed down to my yoke. With my mighty battle array, I covered the land Gambulu in its entirety like a fog. I conquered the city Ša-pī-Bēl, his fortified city, whose location is situated between rivers.
(As for) Nabû-naʾid (and) Bēl-ēṭir, sons of Nabû-šuma-ēreš, the šandabakku (governor of Nippur), whose father, the one who had engendered them, had stirred up Urtaku to fight with the land Akkad — the bones of Nabû-šuma-ēreš, which they had taken out of the land Gambulu to Assyria, 
(As for) Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), the king of the land Elam, he heard about the entry of my troops, who had entered inside the land Elam; he abandoned the city Madaktu, a royal city of his, and (then) fled and took to the mountains (lit. “ascended his mountain”).
Silver, gold, precious stones, possessions, (and) property of that city, as much as there was, garment(s) with multi-colored trim, linen garments, large horses, people — male and female — two tall obelisks cast with shiny zaḫalû-metal, whose weight was 2,500 talents (and which) stood at a temple gate, I ripped (them) from where they were erected and took (them) to Assyria. 
(As for) Gyges, the king of the land Lydia — a region on the opposite shore of the sea, a remote place, the mention of whose name none of the kings, my ancestors, had (ever) heard — (the god) Aššur, (the god) who created me, made him see in a dream my royal name. On the (very) day he saw this dream, he sent his mounted messenger to inquire about my well-being.
(As for) the Cimmerians, a dangerous enemy who had never feared my ancestors, and, with regard to me, had not grasped the feet of my royal majesty, with the support of (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar, my lords, he (Gyges) clamped (them) in manacles, handcuffs, (and) neck-stocks and sent (them) before me, together with his substantial audience gift(s).
In the course of my campaign, I conquered the city Bīt-Imbî, a royal city (and) residence upon which the land Elam relied that blocks the approach to the land Elam like a great wall. (As for) the people living inside it, who had not come out and (iii 50) inquired about the well-being of my royal majesty, I killed (them). I cut off their heads, sliced off their lips, (and) took (them) to Assyria to be a spectacle for the people of my land... 
On a march of one month (and) twenty-five days, I devastated the districts of the land Elam (and) scattered salt (and) cress over them (lit. “it”).
... , the ... day, eponymy of ... , governor of ... 
(As for) Mugallu, the king of the land Tabal who had spoken with disrespect to the kings, my ancestors, he brought to Nineveh (his) daughter, his own offspring, together with a large marriage gift, to serve as a housekeeper, and he kissed my feet. I imposed upon Mugallu an annual payment of large horses.
I took Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II), a son of Urtaku — a (former) king of the land Elam — who had fled to me from Teumman to Assyria (and) had grasped my feet, with me to the land Elam (and) I placed him on Teumman’s throne. I installed Tammarītu, his third brother who had fled to me with him, as king in the city Ḫidalu.
On a march of one month (and) twenty-five days, I devastated the districts of the land Elam (and) scattered salt (and) cress over them.
On my ninth campaign, I mustered my troops (and) took the direct road against Uaiteʾ (Iautaʾ), the king of the land of the Arabs (vii 85) who had sinned against my treaty, had not respected the kindness that I had done for him, and had cast off the yoke of my lordship, which (the god) Aššur had imposed upon him (so that) he pulled my yoke. He refrained from inquiring about my well-being and (vii 90) withheld audience gift(s and) his substantial payment(s), from me. Just like the land Elam, he listened to the lies spoken by the land Akkad and (then) he did not honor my treaty. He abandoned me, Ashurbanipal, the holy priest, (vii 95) the pious servant, the creation of the hands of (the god) Aššur, and he gave (his) forces to Abī-Yateʾ (and) Aya-ammu, son(s) of Teʾri. (vii 100) He sent (them) to aid Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, (my) hostile brother, and he sided (with him). (As for) the people of the land of the Arabs (who were) with him, he made (them) hostile (towards me) and (then) they were constantly plundering the people whom (the god) Aššur, the goddess Ištar, and the great gods (vii 105) had given to me to be their shepherd (lit. “to perform their shepherdship”) and (whom) they had placed in my hands.
(As for) the assault of the weapons of (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar, the great gods, my lords, who had come to my aid to do battle, the troops of Uaiteʾ heard about (this) and they rebelled against him (Uaiteʾ). (ix 95) He (Uaiteʾ) became frightened and came out from the place (where) he had fled. With the support of the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Bēl (Marduk), Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, Šarrat-Kidmuri, Ištar of Arbela, (ix 100) Ninurta, Nergal, (and) Nusku, I captured him and brought him to Assyria.
I, Ashurbanipal, ... creation of the hands of (the god) Aššur ... , son of Esarhaddon, ... 
... , without interruption, ... his heavy payment ... 
(As for) the throne-dais, the seat of his (Marduk’s) exalted divinity, I cast fifty talents of shiny zaḫalû-silver into bricks and (thereby) enlarged it. 
Teumman, the king of the land Elam who had been struck during a mighty battle (and) whose hand Tammarītu, his eldest son, had grasped — they fled in order to save his (Teumman’s) life (and) slipped into the forest. With the support of (the god) Aššur and goddess Ištar, I killed them. I cut off their head(s) in front of one another.
... the city Bīt-Bunakki, a (royal) city of the land Elam.
... who love his good deeds (lit. “the good deeds of his hands”), all of the rulers of the entirety of the lands ... — (As for) Tammarītu, Paʾê, (and) Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), kings of the land Elam whom I had defeated with the support of (the god) Aššur and the goddess Mullissu, ... they stood ... and (then) they prepared their royal meal with their own hands and had (it) brought before me.
For the goddess Mullissu, the lady of the lands who dwells in Emašmaš:
Among the fruit trees of the luxuriant gardens of Karzagina, a pure place, before the stars of heaven — Ea, Šamaš, Asalluḫi, Bēlet-ilī, Kusu, the ... gods — through the craft of the sage, “the washing of the mouth,” ... , he (Marduk) entered inside it (Esagil) and took up residence on (his) eternal dais... 
At that time, I had a stele bearing my name made and I engraved image(s) of the great gods, my lords, on it (and) placed before them an image of my royal majesty beseeching their divinity. I had the praise of the god Marduk, my lord, and my good deeds inscribed upon it and I left (it) for the future... 
From Eḫursaggalkurkurra
Necho, Šarru-lū-dāri, (and) Pa-qruru, kings who the father who had engendered me installed in Egypt, sinned against the treaty (sworn) by (the god) Aššur and the great gods, my lords, and (then) broke their oaths. They forgot the kindness of the father who had engendered me, and their heart(s) plotted evil (deeds). They spoke word(s) of treachery and decided (among) themselves on a profitless decision, saying: “If they remove Taharqa from Egypt, how then can we (ourselves) stay?” To establish treaties and peace, they dispatched their mounted messenger(s) to Taharqa, the king of Kush, saying: “Let peace be established between us so that we can come to a mutual agreement. (Let) us divide the land among ourselves so that no other lord comes between us.” With regard to the numerous troops of Assyria, the might of my lordly majesty, they constantly sought out evil plan(s); they plotted to cut (their) throat(s) (and) strove to completely destroy (them).
For the god Marduk, his lord: Ashurbanipal, king of the world (and) king of Assyria, son of Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria, (and) king of Babylon, had baked bricks made anew for Etemenanki.
(But) as for the one who erases my inscribed name, (or) destroys my royal statue, or changes its position and does not place (it) with his (own) statue, may the god Nabû, supreme lord, glare at him angrily, overthrow his royal rule, and take away his sovereignty! May he (Nabû) make his name (and) his descendant(s) disappear from the lands and have no pity on him!
For the god Sîn of heaven, lion of the gods (and) king of the Enlil (circle of) gods, his lord: 
For the goddess Ningal, queen of Ekišnugal, divine Ninmenna (“Lady of the Crown”), beloved of Ur, his lady:
Copy from a baked brick from the debris of Ur, the work of Amar-Suen, king of Ur, (which) Sîn-balāssu-iqbi, viceroy of Ur, had discovered while looking for the ground-plan of Ekišnugal. Nabû-šuma-iddin, son of Iddin-Papsukkal, the lamentation-priest of the god Sîn, saw (it) and wrote (it) down for display.
May a future ruler, one of the kings, my descendants, repair its dilapidated section(s) when that ... becomes  dilapidated and old.
Before the god Nabû (and) the goddess Tašmētu, my lords, I offered in abundance ... (and) fattened fat-tailed sheep as pure food offerings... 
May a future ruler, one of the kings, my descendants, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that temple becomes dilapidated and old. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, and (then) anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) place (it) with an inscribed object bearing his name. The deities Aššur, Mullissu, Marduk, Zarpanītu, Nabû, (and) Tašmētu will (then) hear his prayers.

On the eighth day of the month Ayyāru I moved from Kalḫu. After crossing the Tigris I approached the city Carchemish of the land Ḫatti. I received from it much of its palace property, the weight of which could not be determined. All the kings of the lands came (and) submitted to me. I took from them hostages (and) they were kept in my presence on the march to Mount Lebanon (lit. “(and) they marched to Mount Lebanon”).
appointee  of the great gods, who always achieved the defeat of those insubmissive to him and (thereby) became lord of all, offspring of Aššur-dān (II) who opened towns (and) founded shrines:
highlands, foremost in battle, king of the four quarters, the one who defeats his enemies, the one who disintegrates all his enemies, king of the totality of the (four) quarters including all their princes, the king who forces to bow down those insubmissive to him, the one who rules all peoples; these destinies came forth
I massacred many of them (and) carried off captives, possessions, (and) oxen from them. The troops were frightened (and) took to a rugged mountain. Since the mountain was exceptionally rugged I did not pursue them. The mountain was as jagged as the point of a dagger and therein no winged bird of the sky flew. Like the nest of the udīnu-bird their fortress was situated within the mountain which none of the kings my fathers had penetrated. For three days the hero explored the mountain. His bold heart (i 75) yearned for battle. He ascended on foot (and) overwhelmed the mountain. He smashed their nest (and) scattered their flock. I felled 200 of their fighting men with the sword (and) carried off a multitude of captives like a flock of sheep. With their blood I dyed the mountain red like red wool, (and) the rest of them the ravines (and) torrents of the mountain  swallowed. I razed, destroyed, (and) burnt their cities.
In the eponymy of Aššur-iddin a report was brought back to me saying Nūr-Adad, the sheikh of the land Dagara, had rebelled;

At that time the temple of the gods Sîn and Šamaš, the great gods, my lords, which ... who preceded me had previously built  — this temple had become dilapidated. I delineated its area, dug out its foundation pit, rebuilt it from top to bottom, (and) completed (it). I newly founded therein the abode of the gods Sîn and Šamaš, the great gods, my lords. I brought inside the gods Sîn and Šamaš. I inscribed my stele (and) deposited (it) therein ...

In this same year I moved out from Inner City (Aššur), crossed Mount Kullar, went down to the interior of the land Zamua, (and) captured the cities of Nikdêra, the Idean. The remnant of their army boarded boats of papyrus and escaped by sea. I boarded boats of inflated skins (and) pursued them. I defeated them in the midst of the sea (and) plundered them.
In my eighth regnal year, at the time of Marduk-zākir-šumi (I), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), Marduk-bēl-usāte, his brother, rebelled against him. I marched out for vengeance  (and) captured the cities Mê-turnat and Laḫiru.
In my fourteenth regnal year I mustered (the troops of my) extensive land in countless numbers (and) crossed the Euphrates in flood with 120,000 of my troops. At that time Hadad-ezer (Adad-idri), the Damascene, (and) Irḫulēnu, the Ḫamatite, together with twelve kings on the shore of the sea, (iii 20) above and below, mustered their troops, which were too numerous to be counted. They attacked me, I fought with them, (and) defeated them. I took away their chariotry, cavalry, (and) military equipment. To save their lives they ran away.
In the future may a later prince ... hear of my heroic deeds (and) recount my praiseworthy power  As I anointed with oil, made sacrifices, (and) returned the monumental inscriptions of former kings to their places,
“So I will go to experience warfare with the Urarṭians,
“I will go down to see whether it is a region with or without water.” Thus he spoke.

He felled Marduk-bēl-usāte with the sword (and) confirmed Marduk-zākir-šumi on his father's throne. I marched about justly in the extensive land Karduniaš (Babylonia). I marched to Baby ion, Borsippa, and Cutha. I made sacrifices to the gods in the shrines of the towns of Karduniaš (Babylonia). I went down to Chaldea (and) gained dominion over Chaldea in its entirety. I received tribute from the kings of Chaldea as far as the sea (and) imposed my powerful might upon the Sealand.
I erected my royal statue.

To the god Marduk, venerable, splendid, the Enlil of the gods, most exalted of the gods, the one who directs all of the gods (and) holds the link between the Igīgū- and Anunnakū-gods, commander, honored god, king of the totality of heaven and netherworld, at whose mention the great gods fearfully attend his command,
Rīmūt-ilī, son of the king.
... regular offerings, the oil presser of the regular offerings, ... 
... he purified. If a provincial governor, a chief administrator (of a temple), a governor, a royal official ... 
... the servants of the god Nabû, my lord, ... 
... he went and ... the governor of Larak.
For the goddess Uṣur-amāssu, august lady, who renders judgment for the land, who makes decision(s) for heaven and netherworld, daughter of the god Adad, beloved of the god Marduk, the one whose command cannot be revoked:
Finally, Bēl-ibni and Nabû-zēra-ušabši, sons of Bulluṭu of Uruk, turned their attention to do this work and to renovate the Akītu (temple). Hoe and basket were taken up by them wholeheartedly and they had an abode of pure riches built for the goddess.
To his lord, Marduk-apla-iddina (II), son of Yakīn, presented (this object).
For the goddess Ninlil, great lady, august lady, compassionate mother, who dwells in Ekurnizu (‟House, Fearsome Mountain”), which is inside Hursagkalama (... ), his lady: 
For the goddess Ištar, supreme lady: Sîn-šarra-uṣur, viceroy of Ur, in order to ensure the good health of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, king of Babylon, gave to the goddesses Ištar and Nanāya (a plot of land measuring) 660 (cubits along its) upper width, bordering (the property of) Atrāya (and) stretching to the estate of the simmagir-official; its upper and lower lengths stretch from the Euphrates (River) to the town Sūrānu.
I mustered the workmen of the gods Enlil, Šamaš, and Marduk and (then) I made (them) carry hoe(s and) imposed (on them the carrying of) basket(s). From the bank of the Araḫtu canal on the upper side, at the gate of the goddess Ištar, to the bank of the Araḫtu <canal> on the lower side, at the gate of the gate of the god Uraš, I removed its heaped up earth. I examined (and) inspected its old foundation and (then) laid its brickwork on its original place. I firmly secured its foundation on the surface (lit. “breast”) of the netherworld. I surrounded the east bank with a strong lining.
O Marduk, (my) lord, joyfully look upon my good deeds and by your exalted command, which cannot be altered, may (this) construction, my handiwork, stay in good repair for ever. Like the bricks of Etemenanki, which are firmly in place for eternity, firmly secure the foundation(s) of my throne until the distant future.
Nabopolassar, king of justice, shepherd chosen by the god Marduk, creation of the goddess Ninmenna — the exalted princess, the queen of queens — protégé of the god Nabû and the goddess Tašmētum, beloved prince of the god Ninšiku:
I firmly secured the bank of that river with bitumen and baked bricks and (thereby) provided the god Šamaš, my lord, with a secure embankment.
One qa.
When the god Marduk, the Enlil of the gods, the prince who deliberates, the sage who knows the hearts of all of the Igīgū gods, sought me out among the widespread people and properly provided for me since my youth, he gave me an appropriate name (and) constantly guided me in places of well-being and health... For my righteousness, with which I always answer him, (and) for my submissiveness, through which I constantly seek respect for his divinity, I plan daily to perform that which is pleasing to him.
O Marduk, supreme lord, the pre-eminent one, the exalted one, the venerated one, the magnificent one, the light of the gods — his ancestors — joyfully look upon my precious handiwork and give to me as a gift a life of long days, the attainment of very old age, a firmly secured throne, and a long-lasting dynasty! 
... , Venus, Saturn, ... , Boötes, ... , the great star(s) who reside in heaven, I established for them a large amount of strewn offerings and I prayed to them for a long life (lit. “a life of long days”), a firmly secured throne, a long reign, (and) making my words gain favor in the presence of the god Marduk, my lord.
(As for) the copper mušḫuššu-dragon(s), which are (stationed) at the bases of the main courtyard and the copper goat-fish ... 
... foot ... If the ‘Finger’ (ubānu) is intact, (then) the lord of the sacrifice will prosper (and) his days will be long.
Nabonidus, the king who reveres the great gods, am I.
When the god Marduk, the great lord, called my name for ruling over the land, made the fame of my royal majesty great among all of the black-headed (people), gave me the people of the four quarters (of the world) to shepherd, ... of his people, ... the four quarters (of the world),
Nabonidus, king of Babylon, the one who provides for Esagil and Ezida.
I performed an extispicy a third time (to ask) about (the suitability of my) daughter, my own offspring, and they answered me (this time) with an auspicious omen.
In order to (receive) great advice from the gods Šamaš and Adad, I started praying.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: "Why have these brothers of Gidgidanu quitted (their) work and left, going away?" —

Nabu-bel-šumati, the legate of Birat entered the Inner City on the 7th. I asked him: "Why did you come now?" He said:

When Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, passes away, you will seat Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, upon the royal throne, and he will exercise the kingship and lordship of Assyria over you. You shall protect him in country and in town, fall and die for him. You shall speak with him in the truth of your heart, give him sound advice loyally, and smooth his way in every respect.
you shall not oust him from the kingship of Assyria by helping one of his brothers, elder or younger, to seize the throne of Assyria in his stead, nor set any other king or any other lord over you, nor swear an oath to any other king or any other lord.
You shall not do (anything) that is evil and improper to Assurbanipal the great crown prince designate, whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, has ordered for you; you shall not seize him and put him to death, nor hand him over to his enemy, nor oust him from the kingship of Assyria, nor swear an oath to any other king or any other lord.
You shall not take a mutually binding oath with (any)one who produces (statues of) gods in order to conclude a treaty before gods, (be it) by setting a table, by drinking from a cup, by kindling a fire, by water, by oil, or by holding breasts, but you shall come and report to Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, son of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, your lord, and shall seize and put to death the perpetrators of insurrection and the traitorous troops, and destroy their name and seed from the land.
This treaty which Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, has confirmed and concluded with you on behalf of Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate and his brothers, sons by the same mother as Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, by making you take an oath, you shall speak to your sons and grandsons, your seed and your seed's seed which shall be born in the future, and give them orders as follows:
You shall not look on ... Assurbanipal, the great crown prince, his brothers ... You shall contest them as you would on your own behalf, and rouse fear in their heart, saying:  "Your father set (this) in a treaty and made us swear it."

Ditto, ditto; may they make you like a fly in the hand of your enemy, and may your enemy squash you.
Just as gall is bitter, so may you, your women, your sons and your daughters be bitter towards each other.
The treaty of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, son of Sennacherib,  king of Assyria, with the governor of Kunalia, with the deputy, the major-domo, the scribes, the chariot drivers, the third men, the village managers, the information officers, the prefects,  the cohort commanders, the charioteers, the cavalrymen, the exempt, the outriders, the specialists, the shield bearers (?), the craftsmen, (and) with all the men of his hands, great and small, as many as there are — with them and with the men who are born after the treaty in the future, from the east ... to the west, all those over whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, exercises kingship and lordship, concerning  Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, the son of Esarhaddon,  king of Assyria, your lord, on whose behalf he established the  treaty with you.
May Sin, the brightness of heaven and earth, clothe you with leprosy and forbid your entering into the presence of the gods or king. Roam the desert like the wild-ass and the gazelle!
May these gods be our witnesses: we will not make rebellion or insurrection against Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, or against Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, or against his brothers, sons by the same mother as Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, and the rest of the sons of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, or make common cause with his enemy.
May Palil, the foremost lord, let eagles and vultures eat your flesh.

Afterwards, a man whom the father of the king, my lord, knew, used  to read them to the king in a qirsu on the river bank. Nowadays it should be done as it (best) suits the king, my lord.
Concerning the observation of Mars about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: "Perform its 'hand-lifting' prayers, and perform them for the crown prince as well" —
If Mars rides Capricorn: devastation of Eridu; its people will be annihilated.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû'a. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The 16th: joy of heart;

The shepherds have (however) bribed both the commandant and the prelate: up till now no account of the bulls and sheep has been made, nor have they supplied the regular ram offerings. They have not (even) sacrificed the king's offerings, the ungelded bulls, in the month Nisan (I), (but) do the bull herdsmen's bidding. They turn the blesser's ungelded bulls back from the (temple) gate, and have served (such bulls) on the table of Nabû.
I became afraid of the punishment ... and wrote to the king, my lord. Let the king, my lord, act as it is suitable to the king, my lord, and to his gods.
Concerning the wall of the Nergal temple of Cutha about which I wrote to the king, my lord:

May the great gods of Heaven and Earth constantly bless your kingship, may they love the pure sacrifices you offer and appreciate your priesthood, may they guard your steps and straighten your path, may they defeat your enemies, slay your foes, drive off your adversaries and pick up their possessions; may they make your leadership as beneficial as choicest oil to the totality of all nations; may they keep the foundation of your throne firm as a rock forever;  may Šamaš, the light of Heaven and Earth, be receptive to a just verdict concerning you.
The very same evening ... the king sent a letter to his servant,  saying "I did not know that you are having such a hard time; (for) I  ... did send for you." The word of the king my lord is as difficult as a mountain!
The king my lord knows me since the time he was a child; I have (always) said: "No ...

An order of the 'farmer' to Adad-šumu-uṣur and Marduk-šakin-šumi: I am well.
Jupiter may remain invisible from 20 to 30 days; now it kept itself back from the sky for 35 days. It appeared on the 6th of Sivan (III) in the area of Orion, exceeding its term by 5 days. The relevant interpretation is as follows:
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-nadin-apli, the foreman of (the collegium of) ten (scribes) of Arbela. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû, Marduk, and Ištar of Arbela bless the king, my lord!
