At the beginning of my reign, in my first palû, in the fifth month after I sat in greatness on the throne of kingship, (the god) Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched against (the Aramean tribes) Ḫamarānu, Luḫuʾatu, Ḫaṭallu, Rubbû, Rapiqu, Ḫīrānu, (5) Rabi-ilu, Naṣiru, Gulusu, Nabātu, Liʾtaʾu, Raḫiqu, Kapiru, Rummulitu (Rummulutu), Adilê, Gibrê, Ubudu, Gurumu, 
In the midst of that battle, I captured Sarduri’s ... I ... 72,950 of their ... from ... (10') ... In order to save his life, Sarduri fled at night and (thus) escaped very quickly before sunrise... With an arrow that cuts off lives, I drove him back to the bridge (crossing over) the Euphrates River, on the border of his land. I took away from him his bed, ... , his royal processional chariot, the cylinder seal (that hung around) his neck, together with his necklace, his royal chariot, ... , their ... , (and) many other things, without number. 
(Completely destroyed)
I received the payment of the Medes, the people of the land Ellipu, and the city rulers of all of the mountain regions, as far as Mount Bikni: (10) 
I captured (and) defeated the cities Daiqanša, Sakka, Ippa, Elizanšu, (5) 
all kinds of precious things from the royal treasure, live sheep whose wool is dyed red-purple, flying birds of the sky whose wings are dyed blue-purple, horses, mules, oxen, and sheep and goats, camels, she-camels, together with their young, I received (from them).

Sarduri of the land Urarṭu revolted against me and conspired with Matīʾ-il (against me). In the lands Kištan and Ḫalpi, districts of the city Kummuḫu, I defeated him and took his entire camp away from him. He became frightened of the terrifying radiance of my weapons and fled alone in order to save his life. 
I fashioned (a statue bearing) image(s) of the gods, my lords, and my royal image out of gold, erected (it) in the palace of the city Gaza, (and) I reckoned (it) among the gods of their land; I established their sattukku offerings. 
The cities Labʾu, 
... he sent ... to Kalḫu, before me, to do obeisance... 
I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire all of his cities. Like tells after the Deluge, I destroyed the lands Bīt-Šilāni, Bīt-Amukāni, and Bīt-Šaʾalli in their entirety, (and) turned (them) into mounds of ruins (lit. “mounds and ruins”). 
I inflicted a heavy defeat upon them. I carried off 60,500 people,  together with their possessions, their horses, their mules, their Bactrian camels, their oxen, (and) their sheep and goats, without number. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities. I turned (them) into mounds of ruins (lit. “mounds and ruins”).
horses, mules, oxen, and sheep and goats, military equipment, 
I sent a eunuch of mine, Aššur-daʾʾinanni, against the mighty Medes in the east. He took 5,000 horses, people, oxen, and sheep and goats, without number.
To put the finishing touch on them (the palatial halls), I arranged knobbed pegs of gold, silver, and bronze around them, and (thus) I made their appearance bright.
(As for) Siruatti the Meʾunite, whose territory is below Egypt, 
I ravaged the land Bīt-Agusi (Arpad) (and) I brought to Assyria 30 talents of gold, 2,000 talents of silver, (and) property. I annexed the land Bīt-Agusi to Assyria (and) placed a eunuch of mine as provincial governor over them.
I fashioned (a statue bearing) image(s) of the great gods, my lords, and my royal image out of gold, erected (it) in the palace of the city Gaza, (rev. 15) (and) I reckoned (it) among the gods of their land; I established their sattukku offerings.
Moreover, she, in order to save her life, set out like a female onager to the desert, a place (where one is always) thirsty. I set the rest of her possessions (and) her tents, her people’s safeguard within her camp, on fire.
I annexed to Assyria the land Unqi (and) placed a eunuch of mine as provincial governor over them.
I annexed to Assyria the extensive land of Bīt-Ḫazaʾili (Damascus) in its entirety, from Mount Lebanon as far as the cities Gilead (and) Abil-šiṭṭi, which are on the border of the land Bīt-Ḫumria (Israel), (and) I placed a eunuch of mine as provincial governor over them.
Palace of Tiglath-pileser (III), great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four quarters (of the world); valiant man who, with the help of (the god) Aššur, his lord, smashed like pots all who were unsubmissive to him, swept over (them) like the Deluge, (and) considered (them) as (mere) ghosts; the king who marched about at the command of the gods Aššur, Šamaš, and Marduk, the great gods, and exercised authority over lands from the Bitter Sea of Bīt-Yakīn, as far as Mount Bikni in the east, up to the Sea of the Setting Sun, as far as Egypt, from the horizon to the zenith, and exercised kingship over them.

I carried off as booty the people of five districts of Ursâ (Rusâ), the Urarṭian, together with their property,  
I conquered six cities of the land Niksamma (and) captured Šēp-šarri, the city ruler of Šurgadia. I added those cities to the province of the land Parsuaš.
The city Kišesim.
The city Bīt-Bagāya.
People from the four (quarters of the world), (speaking) foreign language(s) (and of) diverse speech, those who had dwelt in (both) mountain(s) and (low)land(s), as many as the “Light of the Gods” (Šamaš), the lord of all, shepherded, whom I had carried off as booty by the power of my staff at the command of the god Aššur, my lord, I made act in concert and (re)settled (them) inside it (Dūr-Šarrukīn). I commissioned native Assyrians, masters of every craft, as overseers (and) commanders to instruct (the settlers) in correct behavior (and how) to revere god and king.
I, Sargon (II), king of the world, king of Assyria, built a city and named it Dūr-Šarrukīn. For the sake of my life (and for) the firm establishment of my reign, I built inside it an abode for the gods Sîn (and) Šamaš.
inside 
With the great support of the gods Aššur, Šamaš, Nabû, (and) Marduk, I directed the march into the mountains for a third time. I turned the chariot(s) (lit.: “pointed the yoke”) of the gods Nergal (and) Adad, (whose) standards go before me, towards the lands Zikirtu and Andia. (15) I advanced in between Mount Nikippa (and) Mount Upâ, high mountains that are thickly covered with all kinds of trees, among which (one becomes completely) confused (as to direction), whose very entry is terrifying, (and) over whose (whole) environs, just as in a cedar forest, a shadow is cast with the result that the one who takes the road through them sees no sunlight. I then crossed the Būya River, the river (which flows) between them, twenty-six times, and (my) army did not fear the floodwaters, despite its (the river’s) massive size.
he made abundant water flow like the Euphrates. He had innumerable irrigation ditches run off from it (the canal) and 
Furiouly, I overwhelmed the region around that district like a fog and compacted the length and breadth (of it) like ice. In a lordly manner, I entered the city Ulḫu, the city where Ursâ (Rusâ) went for relaxation, and walked about triumphantly in the palace (that had been) his (own) royal abode. With iron axes and iron spades, I smashed its strong (city) wall, which had been built with (blocks of) massive mountain stone, as if (it were) a pot, and leveled (it) down to the ground. I tore out the lengthy beams of juniper (that formed) the roof of his palace, cut (them) up with pickaxes, and took (them back) to Assyria. I opened up his granaries (and) storehouses and (then) fed my army his abundant grain in unlimited quantities. (220) I entered his hidden wine cellars, and the extensive troops of the god Aššur drew sweet wine (to drink) from waterskins (and) leather buckets as if (it were) river water. I blocked up the outlet of the canal, the canal on which he relied (to provide water), and turned the abundant water (supply) into a swamp. I stopped up the irrigation ditches (and) drainage pipes that forked off from its (the canal’s) center, and exposed ... their pebbles to the sun. I had my fierce warriors enter his well-kept gardens, (which provide) the general impression of his city (and) which were (so) studded with fruit trees and grapevines that they dripped (fruit as abundantly) as a rainfall, and they (the warriors) made the noise of (their) iron pickaxes resound like (the thunder of) the god Adad. (225) They picked a great deal of its fruit, a countless amount, and did not leave (any) for the weary heart to smile about in the future. I (cut down and) spread out his large trees, the ornaments of his palace, like malt (spread out for drying); I made his famous city disgusting and its district a subject of revilement. I gathered up those logs — all the trees that I had chopped down —, piled (them) up in heaps, and set them on fire. I tore out by the roots their abundant crops, which are as countless as reeds in a canebrake, and did not leave even a (single) ear of barley to allow the identification of what had been destroyed. (With regard to) his well-kept field(s) that were spotted with colored flecks like polished lapis lazuli and (whose) meadowland(s) were planted with new vegetation and young shoots, (230) like the god Adad, I trampled (it) down with (my) chariotry, (my) cavalry, (and) the passage of my infantry, and I turned the meadows that his horses had relied on (for pasture) into wasteland. (With regard to) the city Sarduriḫurda, their large fortress, together with fifty-seven settlements in the environs of the district Sangibutu, I destroyed all of them, leveling (them) down to the ground. I set fire to their roof-beams and turned (them) into ashes.
I had my whole army carry away on horses, mules, camel(s), (and) donkeys the great stores of barley (and) wheat that they (the enemy) had heaped up in (their) granaries over a long time for the sustenance of (their) land and people, and I heaped up (the grain) inside my camp (so that the piles looked) like (ruin) mounds. I fed my people abundant food until they were completely full (lit.: “food of abundance and satiety”) and they joyfully laid up lavish travel provisions for the return journey to Assyria. (265) I chopped down his luxuriant orchards; I chopped down his grapevines in large numbers and (thus) put an end to his (source of) drink. I cut down his great forests, whose trees were as tangled up as impenetrable reed thickets, and I laid waste to his meadowland(s). I gathered up all his felled logs like the flotsam after a dust storm and I set (them) on fire. I set fire to one hundred and forty six settlements in their environs as if (they were) brushwood pyres and I made the smoke from them cover the sky like a dust storm.

Ursâ (Rusâ) heard (of this) and threw himself on the ground. He ripped his garments and bared his arms. He tore off his headdress, pulled out his hair, and beat his chest (lit.: “heart”) with both (fists). He lay flat (on the ground), face down. His mood became angry (lit.: “becomes angry”) and his temper burned (hot). Woeful lamentations were on his lips. I caused lamentation to be wailed throughout the land Urarṭu, to its full extent, and established perpetual wailing in the land Naʾiri.

With a rejoicing heart and a radiant face, I rushed to Babylon and entered the palace of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan) to take charge of the possessions and property therein. I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, beds, armchairs, a processional carriage, royal paraphernalia of his with gold (and) silver mountings, all kinds of possessions (and) property without number, a substantial treasure, (together with) his wife, his palace women, female stewards, eunuchs, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, palace servants who cheered up his princely mind, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
(but) not one among them had paid heed to (or) shown interest in the palace inside it, the seat of lordly dwelling whose site had become too small; nor had anyone (of them) conceived of and put his mind towards the straightening of the city’s street(s) and the widening of (its) squares, the dredging of the river, (and) the planting of orchards:
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and called it Kār-Sennacherib.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 89 of his fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 620 small(er) settlements in their environs. I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Cutha, (and) Sippar, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
I placed Bēl-ibni, a son of a rab banî, on his royal throne (and) entrusted him with the people of Akkad. I appointed my eunuchs to be governors over all of the districts of Chaldea and I imposed the yoke of my lordship upon them.
Afterwards, I decided to increase the height of the terrace, then I added 20 courses of brick to the former (terrace) and (thus) I raised (it) to a (total) height of 180 courses of brick. I made the area larger than before, added (it) to the former dimensions of the palace, and (thus) enlarged its structure. 
I had an inscribed object made and inscribed thereon all the mighty victories that I achieved over all of (my) enemies with the support of (the god) Aššur, the great lord, my lord, and everything (else) that I had been doing. I deposited (it) in the foundation of my lordly palace for ever after.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 89 of his fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 620 small(er) settlements in their environs. (10) I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Cutha, (and) Sippar, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, then I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and called it Kār-Sennacherib. (ii 65) I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
On my fifth campaign: The population of the cities Tumurrum, Šarum, Ezāma, Kibšu, Ḫalbuda, Qūa, (and) Qana, whose dwellings are situated like the nests of eagles, the foremost of birds, (iv 75) on the peak of Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain, and who had not bowed down to the yoke — I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Nipur. 
I had fourteen gates opened up in it in four directions, in front and behind, (and) along both sides, for entering and leaving.
“The God Ea Is the One Who Properly Directs (Water Flow into) My Cisterns”: (this is) the Mašqû Gate. (vii 65) “The One Who Brings in Income from the Settlements”: (this is) the Quay Gate. “The One Who Regulates Everything”: (this is) the Armory Gate. In total, three gates (facing) towards the west (and) I gave them (these) names.
I surrounded (and) conquered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, their fortified walled cities. I brought out of them people, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, (ii 1) and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
On my fourth campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me so that I mustered my numerous troops and ordered the march to the land Bīt-Yakīn. (iii 85) In the course of my campaign, I defeated Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean who lives in the marshes, at the city Bittūtu. As for him, terror of doing battle with me fell upon him and (iii 90) his heart pounded. He fled alone like a lynx and his (hiding) place could not be found.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom (iv 1) I had defeated (and) whose forces I had scattered during my first campaign — became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons and my fierce battle array. He flew away like a bird to the city Nagīte-raqqi, (iv 5) which is in the midst of the sea. I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, which is in the swamps (and) marshes, and I counted (them) as booty.
I raged up like a lion, then put on armor (and) placed a helmet suitable for combat on my head. (v 15') In my anger, I rode quickly in my exalted battle chariot, which lays enemies low. I took in my hand the mighty bow that the god Aššur had granted to me (and) I grasped in my hand an arrow that cuts off life.
seeds, thorns (vi 35'') 
distant 
I annually provided irrigation for 600 fields seeded with grain and cereals (located) upstream and downstream of the city.
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. (i 15) He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet. Thus did recalcitrant rulers come to fear battle with me. While they were abandoning their settlements, they flew away alone like bats (living) in crevices to inaccessible place(s).
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
As for him, Hezekiah, fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed him and, after my (departure), he had the auxiliary forces and his elite troops whom (iii 40) he had brought inside to strengthen the city Jerusalem, his royal city, thereby gaining reinforcements, along with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, choice antimony, large blocks of ... , ivory beds, armchairs of ivory, elephant hide(s), elephant ivory, (iii 45) ebony, boxwood, every kind of valuable treasure, as well as his daughters, his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh, my capital city, and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment and to do obeisance.
At that time, by the command of the god Aššur, my lord, Kudur-Naḫundu (Kudur-Naḫḫunte), the king of the land Elam, did not last three months and suddenly died a premature death. After him, Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), (v 15) who does not have sense or insight, his younger brother, sat on his throne.
I quickly slaughtered and defeated Ḫum­ban-un­da­ša, the herald of the king of the land Elam, a trusted man who leads his troops, his main support, together with his magnates, who wear gold (decorated) belt-daggers and have reddish gold sling straps fastened to their forearms, like fattened bulls restrained with fetters.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron (ii 70) who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty and oaths to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah in a hostile manner, they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (ii 75) (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number, and they came to their aid.
On my return march, I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son (whom I) raised on my (own) knee, on his lordly throne and entrusted him with the wide land of Sumer and Akkad.
On my fifth campaign: The population of the cities Tumurrum, Šarum, Ezāma, Kibšu, Ḫalbuda, Qūa, (and) Qana, whose dwellings are situated like the nests of eagles, the foremost of birds, on the peak of Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain, and who had not bowed down to the yoke — I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Nipur. 
I roared loudly like a storm (and) thundered like the god Adad against all of the troops of the wicked enemies. (v 65) By the command of the god Aššur, the great lord, my lord, I blew like the onset of a severe storm against the enemy on (their) flanks and front lines. With the weapons of the god Aššur, my lord, and my fierce battle array, I turned them back and made them retreat. I shot the troops of the enemy with uṣṣu-arrows (and) mulmullu-arrows, and pierced all of their corpses like 
I received gold (and) shining silver sling straps as their wrist-trappings (and) slashed off their belts with sharp swords. I took away gold (and) silver (decorated) belt-daggers as their waist-trappings. 
I brought back all together the chariots along with their horses, whose drivers had been killed in the thick of (that) mighty battle and which had themselves been released so that they galloped about on their own. When the second double-hour of the night had passed, I stopped their slaughter.
In the future, one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar name for shepherding the land and (vi 55) people — when that palace becomes old and dilapidated, may a future ruler renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that palace becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.

I took away the kingship of Lulî, the king of the city Sidon. I placed Tu-Baʾlu on his throne and imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship. 
I struck down with the sword the people of the land Ḫilakku, who live in the mountains. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.

Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), (and) favorite of the great gods:
I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses with slabs of breccia (and) alabaster, and large limestone slabs.
I made bull colossi with copper features, two of which were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, (and) bull colossi of alabaster, together with bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my palatial halls.
I tore down that small palace in its entirety. I diverted <the course of> the Tebilti River from the center of the city and directed its outflow into the meadow behind the city.
In the hidden depths of its subterranean waters I very firmly bonded reeds below (and) bitumen above with large (blocks of) limestone. I raised a plot of land that was 554 cubits long (and) 289 cubits wide out of the water and converted (it) into an empty lot. (40) I added (it) to the former dimensions of the terrace, and raised its superstructure in its entirety 190 courses of brick. I enlarged the structure of the palace to 914 large cubits along (its) longer side and 440 large cubits along (its) shorter side and (thus) I made its site bigger.
I made bull colossi with copper features, two of which were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, (and) bull colossi of alabaster, together with bull colossi (and) sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my palatial halls.
In the course of my campaign, I plundered the cities of his (Ṣidqâ’s) that had not submitted to me. (As for) the governors and the people of the city Ekron who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah, they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number.
I approached the city Ekron and I killed with the sword the governors who had committed crime(s); I counted the citizens who had committed the crimes as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of wrongdoing, be allowed to go free.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress, whose scent is sweet, product(s) of Mount Amanus and Mount Sirāra, the holy mountains. I fastened bands of silver (and) copper on doors of cedar, cypress, (and) juniper and I installed (them) in their gates. 
The goddess Bēlet-ilī, the lady of creation, looked steadfastly upon me and created my features (while I was still) in the womb of the mother who gave birth to me. Moreover, the god Ninšiku gave me wide understanding equal to (that of) the sage Adapa (and) endowed me with broad knowledge.

(As for) Aḫšēri, who did not fear my lordly majesty, (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar placed him in the hands of his servants. The people of his land incited a rebellion against him (and) they cast his corpse into a street of his city.
Afterwards, Uallî, his son, sat on his throne. He saw the might of the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl (Marduk), Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nergal, (and) Nusku, the great gods, my lords, and bowed down to my yoke. (ii 45) For the preservation of his (own) life, he opened up his hands to me (and) made an appeal to my lordly majesty. He sent Erisinni, his heir designate, to Nineveh and he kissed my feet. I had mercy on him. I dispatched my messenger with (a message of) goodwill to him. He sent me (his) daughter, his own offspring, to serve as a housekeeper. (ii 50) (As for) his former payment, which they had discontinued in the time of the kings, my ancestors, they carried (it) before me. I added thirty horses to his former payment and imposed (it) upon him.
(As for) Tammarītu, who had fled to me (and) grasped my feet, I brought him into the city Susa (and) I installed him as king.
I conquered the city Banunu, together with the district of the city Tasarra, all (of it)... I conquered twenty villages in the district of the city Ḫunnir, (which is) on the border of the city Ḫidalu. I destroyed (and) demolished the city Bašimu and the villages in its environs. 
I completed the work of its construction and (then) offered sumptuous offerings to the gods, my lords. During joyous celebrations, I inaugurated it. I entered inside it amidst song(s) of praise.
In the future, may one of the kings, my descendants, whom (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar nominate for ruling over the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when this House of Succession becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, (the name of) my father, (and the name of) my grandfather — the eternal seed of kingship — and (then) anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) place (it) with an inscribed object bearing his name. May the great gods, as many as are recorded on this inscribed object, grant him mighty victories, just like me.

The great gods in their assembly determined a favorable destiny as my lot (and) they glorified the mention of my name (and) made my lordship greater than (those of all other) kings who sit on (royal) daises.
(As for) the throne-dais, the seat of his (Marduk’s) exalted divinity, I cast fifty talents of shiny zaḫalû-silver into bricks and (thereby) enlarged it.
I removed its dilapidated section(s) by the command of the gods Sîn (and) Nusku. I made its structure larger than the one in the days of the past. I built (and) completed (it) from its foundation(s) to its crenellations. Inside it, I built Emelamana, the temple of the god Nusku, the exalted vizier, which no king of the past (who had come) before me had built. I roofed them with long beams of cedar. I fastened band(s) of silver on doors of white cedar (and) I fixed (them) in their gateways. 
In its entirety, I built (and) completed Edimgalkalama, the temple of Great Anu that is inside (the city) Dēr.
I removed its collapsed section(s). In a favorable month, (on) an auspicious day, I (re)laid its foundation(s). In its entirety, I built (and) completed that akītu-house with baked bricks (colored with) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli. I filled (it) with splendor.
He (Šamaš-šuma-ukīn) locked the (city) gates of Sippar, Babylon, (and) Borsippa and (then) broke off (our) brotherly relations. On the wall(s) of those cities, (iii 110) he posted his fighting men and they were constantly doing battle with me. He withheld the performing of my offerings before the gods Bēl (Marduk), Son-of-Bēl (Nabû), the light of the gods — Šamaš — and the warrior — Erra — and he discontinued my giving (them) food offerings. (iii 115) He plotted evil (ways) to deprive (me) of the cult centers, the dwelling place(s) of the great gods whose sanctuaries I had renovated (and) decorated with gold (and) silver, (and) in whose midst I constantly established appropriate procedures.
He forgot the kindness that I had done for him, in having sent aid to him, and constantly sought out evil (ways) to conquer my troops. (v 25) He said the following to himself (lit. “his heart”), saying: “(As for) the people of the land Elam, they have become women. (Who are) they in the face of Assyria? They (the Assyrians) are coming in and constantly plundering the land Elam.” (The god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar, who marched at my side (and) (v 30) allowed me to stand over my foes, saw the dangerous (and) rebellious thought(s) of Tammarītu and called him to account: They removed him from his royal throne and (then) made him return (and) bow down at my feet for a second time. On account of these words, with the fury that my heart had because the unfaithful Tammarītu had sinned against me, through the mighty victories of the great gods, my lords, I marched about triumphantly inside the land Elam in its entirety. 
I conquered the city Nadītu, a royal city, along with its district. I conquered the city Bīt-Bunaki, a royal city, along with its district. I conquered the city Ḫartappānu, a royal city, along with its district. I conquered the city Tūbu, along with its district.
(As for) Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), the king of the land Elam who had seen the rage of the mighty weapons of (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar, he returned from the mountain(s), his place of refuge, and he entered the city Madaktu, which I had destroyed, demolished, (and) plundered by the command of (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar. He sat down in mourning, at a place of mourning.
I stationed six fierce wild bulls of silver, protectors of my royal path, in the Lugudue­ne Gate, the Gate of the Rising Sun, and the Lamma-RA.BI Gate, in Ezida, which is inside Borsippa.
He brought before me his daughter and the daughters of his brothers to serve as housekeepers, together with his substantial payment. He sent at the same time Yāḫi-Milki, his son, who had never crossed the sea, to do obeisance to me.

Moving on from this camp I marched to the cities in the plain of Mount Niṣir which no one had ever seen. I conquered the city Larbusa, the fortified city which (was ruled by) Kirtiara, (and) eight cities in its environs. The troops were frightened (and) took to a rugged mountain. The mountain was as jagged as the point of a dagger. The king with his troops climbed up after them. I threw down their corpses in the mountain, massacred 172 of their fighting-men, (and) piled up many troops on the precipices of the mountain. I brought back captives, possessions, oxen, (and) sheep from them (and) burnt their cities. I hung their heads on trees of the mountain (and) burnt their adolescent boys (and) girls. I returned to my camp (and) spent the night.
(from) Bīt-Adini and the land Ḫatti, and from Lubarna, the Patinu. I settled (them) therein. I cleared away the old ruin hill (and) dug down to water level.

I founded therein a palace of cedar, cypress, daprānu-juniper, boxwood, meskannu-wood, terebinth, and tamarisk as my royal residence (and) for my lordly leisure for eternity. I made (replicas of) beasts of mountains and seas in white limestone and parūtu-alabaster (and) stationed (them) at its doors.

When my army was thirsty and fatigued (lit. “because of the thirst and fatigue of my army”) their army made a fierce attack in strength. But I struck (back), and brought about their defeat. I slaughtered countless numbers of their extensive army. As for him (Šattuara), I chased him at arrow point until sunset. I butchered their hordes (but) 14,400 of them (who remained) alive I blinded (and) carried off. I conquered nine of his fortified cult centers (as well as) the city from which he ruled and I turned 180 of his cities into ruin hills. I slaughtered like sheep the armies of the Hittites and Aḫlamu, his allies. At that time I captured their cities (in the region) from Taʾidu to Irridu, all of Mount Kašiiari to the city Eluḫat, the fortress of Sūdu, the fortress of Ḫarrānu to Carchemish which is on the bank of the Euphrates... I became ruler over their lands and set fire to the remainder of their cities.

At that time the rooms of my great palace on the east side of my city, Aššur, in front of the great ziggurrat of the god Aššur, my lord, which previously Shalmaneser (I), appointee of the god Enlil, vice-regent of Aššur, my father, had built, had become dilapidated and I removed its debris down to the bottom of the foundation pit.

At that time the temple of the Assyrian Ištar, my mistress, which Ilu-šumma, my forefather, vice-regent of Aššur, a king who preceded me, had previously built — 720 years had passed (and) that temple had become dilapidated and old. At that time, at the beginning of my sovereignty, I cleared away its debris down to the bottom of the foundation pit. I rebuilt Eme, “Temple of Cultic Rubrics”, her joyful dwelling, the shrine, her voluptuous dais, (and) the awesome sanctuary; I made them (lit. “which were”) more outstanding than before and made (the temple) as beautiful as a heavenly dwelling. I completed (it) from top to bottom (and) deposited my monumental inscriptions.
May a later prince restore it (and) return my inscribed name to its place. (Then) the goddess Dinitu will listen to his prayers.
who became lord and the district of 
At that time the god Aššur, my lord, requested of me a cult center on the bank opposite my city, the desired object of the gods, and he commanded me to build his sanctuary. At the command of the god Aššur, the god who loves me, I built before my city, Aššur, a city for the god Aššur on the opposite bank, beside the Tigris, in uncultivated plains (and) meadows where there was neither house nor dwelling, where no ruin hills or rubble had accumulated, and no bricks had been laid. I called it Kār-Tukultī-Ninurta. I cut straight as a string through rocky terrain, I cleared a way through high difficult mountains with stone chisels, I cut a wide path for a stream which supports life in the land (and) which provides abundance, and I transformed the plains of my city into irrigated fields. I arranged for regular offerings to the god Aššur and the great gods, my lords, in perpetuity from the fish (lit. “produce”) of the water of that canal.
When the god Aššur sent me to the lands Nairi and the lands on the coast of the Upper Sea, I swept over with my raging warfare (and) conquered all the lands Nairi and the lands on the coast of the Upper Sea. (Thus) I became lord over their forty kings, subdued (them) at my feet, and imposed (upon them) corvée.

(In the section) from the battlements to the roof of the temple I tore down fifteen old layers of brick (and) raised (this section) fifty layers of brick (thus) making it thirty-five layers of brick higher than before. I put stone rosettes all around them.

With the onslaught of my fierce weapons by means of which the god Aššur, the lord, gave me strength and excellence I took my warriors trained for successful combat (ii 65) with thirty of my chariots escorting my aggressive shock troops. I marched to the land Išdiš (where) rebellious (and) insubmissive people (lived). (ii 70) Riding in my chariot when the way was smooth and going by foot when the way was rough, I passed through the rough terrain of mighty mountains. In Mount Aruma, a difficult area which was impassable for my chariots, I abandoned my chariotry.
